This GitHub repository contains the full implementation and analysis for the COS30015 IT Security Practical Assignment, under the topic:

“Tracing and Classifying Spam Emails: A Machine Learning and Threat Intelligence Approach”

In this project, we aim to address the growing challenge of unsolicited and malicious emails (spam) by integrating machine learning-based classification with threat intelligence techniques such as IP geolocation, WHOIS domain lookups, and spam-type categorization.
The project not only detects spam using supervised learning (Logistic Regression) but also analyzes email origins, content-based spam strategies, and IP/domain behavior patterns.
