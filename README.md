Title: Tracing and Classifying Spam Emails: A Machine Learning and Threat Intelligence Approach 

This repository presents the full implementation and evaluation of a dual-layered system developed to detect, trace, and analyse spam emails. The project integrates machine learning-based classification (using Logistic Regression) with threat intelligence techniques such as IP geolocation, WHOIS domain lookups, and spam-type categorisation.

The system is designed not only to distinguish spam from legitimate emails but also to uncover the origin, distribution tactics, and behavioural patterns of spam campaigns. It highlights vulnerabilities in traditional detection systems by showcasing missed detections (false negatives) and analysing their characteristics. The project emphasises practical application and cybersecurity relevance, aligning with the objectives of attacker and malware analysis under COS30015-Practical Research project-S1_2025.
