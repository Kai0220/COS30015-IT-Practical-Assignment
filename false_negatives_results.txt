Email Subject: Proposal for cooperation
Email Text: Proposal for cooperationProposal for cooperation Hello. I meant to contact http://taint.org webmaster,
Am I correct, I hope?

Actually, I am not quite sure... Did I or Natasha Fedorova write 
you before to your other address? Anyway, now I am here instead of 
her too.

So, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.

I have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, 
possibly you will find it interesting.

People are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?

The thing is that I could get you in touch with developers from
Russia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for
considerably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or 
pay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all
programming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content
writing, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may
accept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and
devote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.
Alternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more
features to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from
$12, and an average of $18 an hour.

I have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.html

As for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their
specialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.
So, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet 
deadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant 
is online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also 
their company has local consultants in many states throughout the 
USA, in Europe and Australia.

So, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?

Thank you very much,
Oksana Svetlova.
oksana@antee.com

PS. Just in case you need any type of IT works now, please let me 
know a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation.

Email Subject: New Product Announcement
Email Text: New Product AnnouncementNew Product Announcement NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT

From: OUTSOURCE ENG.& MFG. INC.


Sir/Madam;

This note is to inform you of new watchdog board technology for maintaining
continuous unattended operation of PC/Servers etc. that we have released for
distribution.
  
We are proud to announce Watchdog Control Center featuring MAM (Multiple
Applications Monitor) capability.
The key feature of this application enables you to monitor as many
applications as you
have resident on any computer as well as the operating system for
continuous unattended operation.  The Watchdog Control Center featuring
MAM capability expands third party application "control" of a Watchdog as
access to the application's
source code is no longer needed.

Here is how it all works:
Upon installation of the application and Watchdog, the user may select
many configuration options, based on their model of Watchdog, to fit their
operational needs.  If the MAM feature is enabled, the user may select any
executable program that they wish for monitoring.

A lock up of the operating system or if any one of the selected
applications is not running, the MAM feature, in
conjunction with the Watchdog, will reset the system allowing for
continuous operation.

It's that simple!

Watchdog Control Center is supported on most Microsoft Windows platforms
(Win9x/WinNT/Win2k) and includes a Linux version for PCI Programmable
Watchdogs.

Watchdog Control Center Features:
- Automated installation
- Controls all Outsource Engineering Watchdogs
- User selectable Watchdog timeout period
- User selectable Watchdog stroke interval
- Multiple Application Monitoring

Included on the Installation CD:
- Watchdog Control Center
- Watchdog Drivers
- Documentation

For more information, please visit out website at
http://www.outsrc-em.com/ or send an e-mail to sales@outsrc-em.com
