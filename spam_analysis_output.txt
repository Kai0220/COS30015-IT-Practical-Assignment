Preview: FROM:MR JOE MARK EMAIL FAX: 1 561 619 2791 EMAIL:mrjoemark@yahoo.com  DEAR SIR   REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP � STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.   Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and �TOP SECRET.� Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.   We have decided to contact you first by your email due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we decided it is best using the email. Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr. Kaku Opa, a director general in the Ministry  of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man tender board appointed by the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts to individuals and companies and to approve such contract payments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. The duties of the committee also include evaluation, vetting and monitoring of work done by foreign and local contractors in the ministry.  I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence. In order to commence this business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds.   The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996 and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some rural electrification projects.   However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the intention that the committee will share the excess when the payments are approved.   The Federal Government have since approved the total contract sum which has been paid out to the companies and contractors concerned which executed the contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars, which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves.  We need your assistance as the funds are presently secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government specifically set aside for the settlement of outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are handicapped  in the circumstances as the civil service code of conduct, does not allow us to operate off-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole transaction.   My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70% will be for us (members of this panel) and the remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return we demand your complete honesty and trust.   It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here, the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts. We are civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a life time opportunity.  You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed cases of business associates running away with funds kept in their custody when it finally arrive their accounts. We have decided that this transaction will be based completely on the following:   (a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence.   (b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.   (c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly release our share (70%) on demand after you have removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled.   (d). You must be ready to produce us with enough information about yourself to put our minds at rest.   Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten Bank working days from the date of  receipt of the necessary information and requirement from you.   Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my email address mrjoemark@yahoo.com. I will bring you into the complete picture of the transaction when I have heard from you.   Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we are already behind schedule for this financial quarter.   Thank you and God bless.   Yours faithfully,   Mr Joe Mark  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? LAUNCH - Your Yahoo! Music Experience http://launch.yahoo.com

Preview: FROM THE DESK OF: Dr tom eke. E-Mail:dr_tomeke@spinfinder.com LAGOS - NIGERIA.   ATTN:     REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.   It is with my profound dignity that I write you this very important and highly confidential letter. First, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and "TOP SECRET". Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried,considering the fact that we have not met each other before, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you, so we decided it is best using the e-mail,which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the second quater payment for the year 2000.   However, let me start by introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr.tom eke, a Director General in the Department Of Petroleum  Resources(D.P.R) and I presently head The Contract Award Panel incharge of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum CONFIDENCE. I and my colleagues are Top Officials of the Federal Government Contract Award Panel. Our duties include Evaluation, Vetting, Approval for payment of Contract jobs done for the D.P.R e.t.c. In order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your Account the said funds. The source of this funds is as follows: In the second quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of US$400 million US dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and installation of Oil Pipe lines in Warri and Port Harcourt. During this process my colleagues and I decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over-inflate the total contract sum from US$400 million to US$431 million United States dollars with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of US$31 miilion amongst ourselves.   The Federal Government of Nigeria has since the second quater of	 year 2001 approved the sum of US$431 million for us as the contract sum,  and the sum of US$400 million has also been paid to the foreign companies  concerned as contract entitlements for the various contracts done, but  since the companies are entiltled to US$400 million dollars only, we are  now left with US$31 million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel, we cannot do this by ourselves, as we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in Government service, making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names right now. I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of US$31 million. Hence we are writing you this letter. My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf, you or your Company will retain 20% of the total amount (US$31 million), while 70% will be for us(OFFICIALS) and the remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return we demand your complete honesty and trust.   You must however NOTE that this transaction will be strictly based  on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below;  a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence  b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality  c) That you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody, or any form of blackmail.  d) That upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of 20% from the total amount.  Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you . We are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your Total Confidentiality in this transaction. There is no cause for alarm. I give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us. Transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most Government executives. Here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day, thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken out of Nigeria, this is because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future, so that when we retire from active service we donot languish in poverty. I will explain more to you when I have heard from you.   Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e-mail address.  I will bring you into the complete picture of this pending business transaction when I have heard from you and also receive your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all necessary information you need to know about our pending business transaction. I will also send to you my private telephone and fax numbers where you can always reach me. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds under the second quarter of the year 2002. Thank you and God Bless.   Yours faithfully,   Dr.tom eke.   N.B. PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL AND COMPLETELY FREE FROM DRUG MONEY OR MONEY LAUNDERING. THIS IS A COMPLETE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.  --
