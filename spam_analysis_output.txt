Label: Spam
Preview: Mr.Vincent Nnaji,  Standard Trust Bank Ltd,  Lagos,Nigeria.  Dear Sir,  I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.  I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address.  Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest.  Thanks and Regards,  MR.VINCENT NNAJI.

My  >defragmentor  keeps starting over and over and my scan  >disk never finds anything wrong, but there has to be.   Dear Nicety,  As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking  up your computer I'm afraid your "SOL" as finding a true solution.   There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts  resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many  programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working  in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a  regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened  and closed several different applications.  Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional, wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating system vs Windows NT.  You can read it at  http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is  even truer today.  Every current "worm" you are hearing about  on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems.    So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change  the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of  weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running  I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over.  I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and  the price is right -- free.

Comments on Site #140:  http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com/masterminding Margarete MDegaston@aol.com ~~~~  I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate  sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well  presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been  a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site,  preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a  relationship to it.  What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something  related to the url  "prosperouswomen" to come up, as this  "word" was what caught my attention and caused me to  click in the first place.  I feel the book page should be a tool for the "PW" page and  not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the  book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page. (You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)  With these:  Find out how you can receive the free book. Email us at directions4U@aol.com         and For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing  write to us at directions4U@aol.com  I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than  copy and paste.  Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them.  (and I have ordered the book!) ~~~~  I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.   Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics  or where we were headed. ~~~~  Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.  Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish  between the links and that which is not.  I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also  linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that  link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.  If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a  request message to an aol email address you would get more  requests, and also might be able to automate this process. ~~~~  I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point. It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.   If only other sites we so simplistic! ~~~~  With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact  on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences  in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box  with "Life Changeing Insight" needs the 'e' taken out of  'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended  to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100  year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of  using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where  or how or by whom it was discovered.  The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that  would make the site more effective (on getting people to request  the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in  what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to  order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form  for this just about anywhere. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________________________ moderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com posting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com ______________________________________________________  Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:    mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com Please send suggestions and comments to:    mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com  To change your subscribed address, send both new and old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com See below for unsubscribe instructions.
