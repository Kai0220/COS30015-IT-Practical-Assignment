d_akh@hotmail.com,Re: Got Ink?              21846,"Wed, 17 Jul 2002 20:28:03 -1600","What have you been up to?
I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of going
down to the store to find out that your printer cartridges
cost more than the printer itself! I know how you feel
- I print over 500 pages a day, and it feels like there is
a vacuum sucking money out of my wallet! Now, this has got
to stop because I know it doesn't cost the printer companies
anywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work!
Well, it finally has.  The SUPERINK solution.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Gosh darn, not another
cheap knockoff printer cartridge!""  Like you, I was very 
skeptical at first, but my best friend & business associate
said it helped her save over $100 a month on printer supplies. 
So I tried it.  I mean, there was nothing to lose because they
offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee, up to a one-year warranty
on all of their products and FREE Shipping on ALL orders!
Let me tell you, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
Period.  Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you,
I've gone from spending $1000 dollars a month on printer supplies
to Now ONLY $475! and I haven't had to sacrifice the quality or
service that I received from the local office supply store. In fact,
the service is even BETTER!  I've had 1 defective cartridge since 
I started dealing with SUPERINK and they sent me a new replacement
within 3 days, no questions asked. Now, I can print all I want!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted their manufacturer
and got permission to be a reseller - at a BIG discount.  I want
to help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies
like I did. Because a penny saved is a penny earned! 
I give you my personal pledge the SUPERINK soltuion will absolutely
WORK FOR YOU. If it doesn't, you can return your order anytime
for a full refund.    

If you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the
printer companies, or tired of poor quality ink & toner cartridges,
then I recommend - the SUPERINK solution.

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how do we save all this money
without losing quality and service?""

Modern technology has provided SUPERINK with unique, revolutionary
methods of wax molding that allow the ink & toner to 'settle', which
prevents any substantial damage that would occur during shipping and
handling. Nothing ""magic"" about it - just quality & savings, BIG SAVINGS!

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you save 30%-70% per week/per month/per year or per lifetime 
by purchasing any of our ink & toner supplies. Just try it once, you'll 
keep coming back - there's nothing to lose, and much MONEY to be saved! 
100% Satisfaction Guaranteed. You will be able to print as much as you
want without wasting money or sacrificing quality - GUARANTEED.
That is my pledge to you.

money/credit card information upfront in some slick way, after-the-fact !
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down ( I have been self-employed all my life ), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment ( great! because
I had none ) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if ( when ) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics. This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know:  Whats it all about ? and  How
does it work ?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines:  Join free and Make $10,000 every week

"""DR.OLUFEMI COKER"" <olu_101@mail.com>",INVITATION TO TREAT,"Mon, 22 Jul 2002 22:56:32 -0700","FROM THE DESK OF:DR.OLUFEMI COKER,
ECONOMIC RECOVERY COMMITTEE,
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT, 
LAGOS-NIGERIA.

						
FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,

BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$ 22.5 M (TWENTY TWO
MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)
& BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP.

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction, this is by  virtue of it's nature as
being utterly confidential and top secret as you were
introduced to us in confidence through the Nigerian
Chamber of Commerce, foreign trade division.

 I am the chairman of the Economic Recovery Committe
(ERC) set up by the present civilian Government of
Nigeria to review contracts awarded  by the past
military administration.

In the course of our work at the ERC, we discovered
this fund which resulted from gross re-valuation of
contracts  by top government officials of  the last
administration. The companies that executed the
contracts have been duly paid and the contracts
commissioned leaving the sum of US$22.5 Million
floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of
Nigeria  ready for payment.

I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by
my colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas
partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$22.5M
legally subcontracting the entitlement to you/your
company. This is bearing in mind that our  civil
service code of conduct forbids us from owning 
foreign company or running  foreign account while in
government service hence the need for an overseas
partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus
after it has been paid into your account:
(1) 25% of the money will go to you for acting as the
beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 5% has been set aside as an abstract projection
for reimbursment to both parties for incidental
expences that may be incurred in the course of the
transaction.
(3) 70% to us the government officials (with  which we
wish to commence an importation business in
conjunction with you ). 
 
All logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction 
within ten to fourteen days of commencement after
receipt of the following information:  Your  full
name/ company name, address, company's details &
activities, telephone & fax numbers.

These information will enable us make the applications
and lodge claims to the concerned ministries &
agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent
to state here that this transaction is entirely  based
on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque
drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria
correspondent bankers in America, Asia and Europe is
going to be made in your name.Please acknowledge the
receipt of this letter  using my personal E-mail
address.

Yours Faithfully,

It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.

I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Compan!

Oksana Svetlova <oksana@antee.com>,Proposal for cooperation,"Wed, 27 Feb 2002 06:34:18 +0400","Hello. I meant to contact http://taint.org webmaster,
Am I correct, I hope?

Actually, I am not quite sure... Did I or Natasha Fedorova write 
you before to your other address? Anyway, now I am here instead of 
her too.

So, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.

I have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, 
possibly you will find it interesting.

People are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?

The thing is that I could get you in touch with developers from
Russia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for
considerably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or 
pay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all
programming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content
writing, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may
accept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and
devote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.
Alternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more
features to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from
$12, and an average of $18 an hour.

I have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.html

As for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their
specialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.
So, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet 
deadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant 
is online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also 
their company has local consultants in many states throughout the 
USA, in Europe and Australia.

So, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?

Thank you very much,

So, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet  deadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant  is online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also  their company has local consultants in many states throughout the  USA, in Europe and Australia.  So, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?  Thank you very much, Oksana Svetlova. oksana@antee.com  PS. Just in case you need any type of IT works now, please let me  know a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation."

If you are fed up of being 'ripped off' by the British government every time you buy your tobacco, then you should visit our website, where you can now buy 4 cartons of cigarettes, or 40 pouches of rolling tobacco from as little as 170 Euros (approx 105 pounds), inclusive of delivery by registered air mail from our office in Spain.  

Why pay more???

#263 SANDTON CITY
JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.
E-MAIL: joel_rose1@mail.com


ATTN:ALHAJI

With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this
proposal, which I believe, would be of great interest
to you. I am Mrs. regina Rossman, the wife of late Mr.
Joseph Rossman of blessed memory, before forces loyal
to
Major Johnny Paul Koromah killed my husband; he was
the Director General of Gold and Mining Corporation
(G.D.M.C.) of Sierra Leone. My husband was one of the
people targeted by the rebel forces. On the course of
the revolution in the country, prominent people were
hijacked from their homes to an unknown destination.

Two days before his death, he managed to sneak a
written message to us, explaining his condition and
concerning one trunk box of valuables containing
money, which he concealed under the roof. He
instructed me to take our son and move out of Sierra
Leone, immediately to any neighboring country. The
powerful peace keeping force of the �(ECOMOG)�
intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by
the rebels, which was the order of the day.
Eventually, it resulted into full war, I became a
widow overnight, helpless situation, without a partner
at the moment of calamity, and every person was
running for his life. My son and I managed to escape
to South Africa safely with the box and some documents
of property title.

The cash involved inside the box was US$30 Million
(Thirty Million United States Dollars). Due to fear
and limited rights as a refugee, I deposited the items
with a private security company in order not to raise
an eyebrow over the box here in South Africa in my
son�s name JOEL R. ROSSMAN. Be informed that the real
content of the box was not disclosed. Meanwhile, I
want to travel out of South Africa entirely with this
money for investment in your country because of
political and economic stability and for future
benefit of my child.


I want you to assist us claim this box from the
security company and get the money into your private
account in your country so that we can invest the
money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding
investment and good relationship with you.


Concerning the money, we are prepared to give you
reasonable percentage of 30% for your kind assistance.
Also, we have decided to set aside 5% of the total sum
for expenses that might be incurred by the parties in
the course of the transfer both locally and
externally. For the interest of this business, do not
hesitate to contact my son Mr. JOEL R. ROSSMAN on the
above e-mail address immediately you
receive this message for more information and to
enable
us proceed towards concluding all our arrangements. No
other person knows about this money apart from my son
and I. We await your most urgent response.please we
need your fax/phone numbers for esiear communication.

Thanking you for your co-operation and God bless you.

Ben Green <bengreen@mindupmerchants.com>,One of a kind Money maker! Try it for free!,"Fri, 13 Sep 2002 20:38:55 -0700","CONSANTLY being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way, after-the-fact !
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down ( I have been self-employed all my life ), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment ( great! because
I had none ) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if ( when ) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics. This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know:  Whats it all about ? and  How
does it work ?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines:  Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life  yeah, right! I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to
finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free.  Good luck! http://www.mindupmerchants.com/default.asp?ID=5581 Ben Green, (775) 322-3323 P.S.Free POP3 email is ofered for members now!",192.168.0.0,192.168.0.0,1,,,"CONSANTLY being bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your money/credit card information upfront in some slick way, after-the-fact !

Internet Success Through Simplicity
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Every day of the week, I get questions from people all over the world, including my No BS GIMG Members, wanting to know some of the most valuable ""secrets"" to my on-going internet success. Let me say, above all else, I don't believe there are any *true* ""secrets"" to success on the Net. What you do to become successful in the online world is not a ""secret"", in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the Net or off. But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, consultation, or simply asking, ""What's your secret?"", I have to blush & say ... Persistence and personality. Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret. Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. It's not years of digging to find the ""secrets"" to internet riches. One thing that ""gets to me"" so often in my work as an Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stands between themselves and success on the Net. It's almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims of what works and what doesn't work, and so many LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in their online venture, that ""success"" is the equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall. It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!! Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking the Bank. Get it!! http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb . But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your online venture a success. And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of ""self marketing"" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't agree with him more. Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying. The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have standing high as you can see, blocking the path between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there to fear to begin with ... get over it!! What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. When you realize this, you will tear down that brick wall by means of complete and instantaneous disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, which is the only ""real"" place it ever was anyhow! Yes, ""persistence and personality"" inherently includes honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate goals and realize that probably the most valuable, powerful key to your success ... is YOU! That may be the most incredible ""secret"" we ever uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.

branding, and provide information.......with a 12 month goal 
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart. 
We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments 
via our site.
Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information, and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service.
The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown 
outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and 
I've been in this business for 25 years. The Internet is not 
dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and 
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services 
on-line as well. Our site (the first we've developed) has 
exceeded our expectations, and we aren't satisfied with it 
yet.......we just wanted to get it there for information! Jeff and Rebecca Marks http://www.grand-champion.com ------------------------------------------------- Branding. While quality customer service and product 
have been and will always be our top priority brand building 
Zesto is our most challenging task. Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on 
all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions. Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless. Arlene Turner http://www.zesto.com =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Let me say, above all else, I don't believe there are any *true* ""secrets"" to success on the Net. What you do to become successful in the online world is not a ""secret"", in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the Net or off. But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, consultation, or simply asking, ""What's your secret?"", I have to blush & say ... Persistence and personality. Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret. Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. It's not years of digging to find the ""secrets"" to internet riches. One thing that ""gets to me"" so often in my work as an Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stands between themselves and success on the Net. It's almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims of what works and what doesn't work, and so many LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in their online venture, that ""success"" is the equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall. It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!! Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking the Bank. Get it!! http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb . But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your online venture a success. And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of ""self marketing"" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't agree with him more. Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying. The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have standing high as you can see, blocking the path between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there to fear to begin with ... get over it!! What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. When you realize this, you will tear down that brick wall by means of complete and instantaneous disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, which is the only ""real"" place it ever was anyhow! Yes, ""persistence and personality"" inherently includes honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate goals and realize that probably the most valuable, powerful key to your success ... is YOU! That may be the most incredible ""secret"" we ever uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.

Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret. Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. It's not years of digging to find the ""secrets"" to internet riches. One thing that ""gets to me"" so often in my work as an Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stands between themselves and success on the Net. It's almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims of what works and what doesn't work, and so many LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in their online venture, that ""success"" is the equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall. It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!! Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking the Bank. Get it!! http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb . But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your online venture a success. And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of ""self marketing"" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't agree with him more. Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying. The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have standing high as you can see, blocking the path between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there to fear to begin with ... get over it!! What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. When you realize this, you will tear down that brick wall by means of complete and instantaneous disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, which is the only ""real"" place it ever was anyhow! Yes, ""persistence and personality"" inherently includes honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate goals and realize that probably the most valuable, powerful key to your success ... is YOU! That may be the most incredible ""secret"" we ever uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.

We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments  via our site. Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation  was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in  traditional media and by referral for more information, and  to make a professional impression on someone you may not  meet before providing service. The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown  outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and  I've been in this business for 25 years. The Internet is not  dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and  the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services  on-line as well. Our site (the first we've developed) has  exceeded our expectations, and we aren't satisfied with it  yet.......we just wanted to get it there for information! Jeff and Rebecca Marks http://www.grand-champion.com ------------------------------------------------- Branding. While quality customer service and product  have been and will always be our top priority brand building  Zesto is our most challenging task. Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on  all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering  the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone  would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to  build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout  our site as well as search engine submissions. Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy  to remember and trademarked works in our favor because  the marketability potential is limitless.

Steve Adler <stephen.adler@allexecs.org>,Summer Job Interviews. . . .,"Thu, 25 Jul 2002 11:29:33 +0800","Greetings!

If you're thinking about a new job, now's the time to
aggressively pick up your search. Many people slow
their job search donw in summer months when in fact
it's the best time to look!

Here's why.  Many companies implement a new direction
or strategy at the first of the year, resulting in a
first of the year hiring surge. By mid year, with
results in hand, companies start hiring again to
expand on or adjust for the results of their first of
the year plans.

While employers start hiring, job seekers start
slowing their search efforts down. This creates an
optimal job seeking environment of more jobs and less
competition!

To best take advantage of this situation you should give
yourself massive exposure by signing up to all the top
career sites as soon as possible. Of course it will take
a little time, but it's well worth it. The top career
sites are visited by 1.5 million employers and recruiters
daily - And collectively list millions of jobs.

If you want to save 60 hours of research and data entry,
try a service called ResumeRabbit.com.  They instantly
post your resume to 75 the top career sites at once.
You'll find this service at http://start.resumerabbit.com

With this service you fill out one simple form in about
15 minutes and you'll be instantly seen on Monster.com,
HotJobs.com, Job.com CareerBuilder.com, Dice.com and more!

When searching for a new job, it's important to work
smart and cover a lot of ground. Today's serious job
seeker must take a multi-pronged approach to succeed.
This should include networking, reading all the
classifieds, posting your resume on all the top career
sites and searching job listings on these sites daily.

We recommend you try http://start.resumerabbit.com
It's a quality service that delivers what it promises.

>>From mid November to mid January, the holidays have
a ""slowing down"" effect on hiring. Since the job search
process can often be several months, waiting until the
end of summer to get started may push your new job off
well after the new year.  Now's the optimum time to
aggressively mount your search!

Sincerely,


Steve Adler

BARRISTER JOHNSON AKERELE <adewale1@mail.com>,REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE,"Mon, 22 Jul 2002 14:31:56 -0700","BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER CHAMBERS
Legal Practitioners / Notary Public
Blk 804- Law House Building
Lagos-Nigeria.

For your kind attention,


              REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.

I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.

Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.


Yours Faithfully

BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.

                    STRICTLY PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL
I am MR.Johnson S. Abu, the bills and exchange Director at the
ForeignRemittance Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria.  I am 
writingyou
this letter to ask for your support and cooperation to carrying thisbusiness
opportunity in my department.  We discovered abandoned the sumof
US$37,400,000.00 (Thirty seven million four hundred thousand unitedstates
dollars) in an account that belong to one of our foreign customers,an
American
late Engr. John Creek (Junior) an oil merchant with the federal government
of
Nigeria who died along with his entire family of a wifeand two children in
Kenya Airbus (A310-300) flight KQ430 in November2000.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next of kin tocome
over
and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannotrelease the fund
from his account unless someone applies for claims asthe next  of kin to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, neither
their
family member nor distant relative hasappeared to claim the said fund.  Upon
this discovery, I and other officialsin my department have agreed to make
business with you release the totalamount into your account as the heir of
the
fund since no one came forit or discovered either maintained account with
our
bank, other wisethe fund will be returned to the bank treasury as unclaimed
fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus: 30%for
you as
foreign partner and 70% for us the officials in my department.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, my colleague and I
willcome to
your country and mind our share. It is from our 60% we intendto import
computer
accessories into my country as way of recycling thefund.  To commence this
transaction we require you to immediately indicateyour interest by calling
me
or sending me a fax immediately on the aboveTelefax # and enclose your
private
contact Telephone #, Fax #, full nameand address and your designated
banking co-
 ordinates to enable us fileletter of  claim to the appropriate department
for
necessary approvalsbefore the transfer can be made.

Note also, this transaction must be kept strictly confidential becauseof its

Iguess it will always be slow with all that. I do not like pop up pagesand there wasone that kept doing that. Some of the pages were really pretty but the animationdid not fit the mood of the page. A tremendous amout of work has beenput into the page. There are so many places to host websites inexpensively, whydon't you have your own domain? You ought to check into that. ~~~~ Thisis a very lovely site, the graphics are awesome and the games are fun aswell. You may want to look into purchasing your own domain name and ahost that offers bannerless hosting (at least without the pop-ups). ~~~~ Hmm...too much input! There's way too much loading on this page. I don't likethe wav file loading and though I didn't here anything windows prompted mefor a MP3 decoder, so I presume one of those was loading as well. Some ofthe links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also text basedor smaller gifs and put on the index page. For a minute I didn't know whereto go. ~~~~ Thiswas a neat site.� The site was original and I could tell that Mrs.T certainly seemsto enjoy working on her site.� The graphics were pretty, or funny, dependingon each one, but well arranged. But, the text on the home page wasgoing from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlapped theleft rose border. I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.�Also, I think usinga sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did likehow thefont color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internet explorer. Idon't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guide page,it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts, interactiveopinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site to thesite content helps when new visitors visit. Onyour home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics. Ifyou do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showing differentpictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the same pictureon each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website.On yourarticles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics because ofthe background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the background behindthat would work better. Lookfor a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have checked out more pagesbut I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page. Iwent to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is mucheasier todeal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there. ~~~~ Thisis an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not allof which Ivisited - and it has something for every member of the family, however,most ofit is for either mothers or the kids. She even has some games to play -good forsmaller kids, too! Mrs. T., as she is known, is quite creative - and Iwould recommendthis site for the whole family. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ VOTEON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!

Besure to include your signature file so you get credit (and exposure toyour site). -- But NO self promotion or affiliate program links! -- mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com ++++Resource Post #1 ++++ From:Peter A Steeves Subject:Internet Explorer Hint w/ ""Image Toolbar"" Iupdated to Internet Explorer Version: 6.00.2462.0000 a few weeksago. I am now receiving less BOMBS when I am on-line; therefore,I believe it is better than the last version. Thereis, though, one little agonizing message ""Image Toolbar"" thatpops up every time you pass the mouse over an image. Itasks whether you want to save or print the image. UGH, whata pest. Hurrah,you can get rid of the Image Toolbar. Just performa Right Mouse Click over the Image Toolbar. Itwill allow you to disable the Image Toolbar for thissession or forever. If you want to re-establish theImage Toolbar just go to the Internet Options ControlPanel and you can turn the Image Toolbar back on. Remember,a right mouse click over any Windows Icon, Window,tool bar, the Desktop, and most other Windows entitieswill list loads of information. Use it, get thehang of it, you'll like it. PeterA.

Iguess it will always be slow with all that. I do not like pop up pagesand there wasone that kept doing that. Some of the pages were really pretty but the animationdid not fit the mood of the page. A tremendous amout of work has beenput into the page. There are so many places to host websites inexpensively, whydon't you have your own domain? You ought to check into that. ~~~~ Thisis a very lovely site, the graphics are awesome and the games are fun aswell. You may want to look into purchasing your own domain name and ahost that offers bannerless hosting (at least without the pop-ups). ~~~~ Hmm...too much input! There's way too much loading on this page. I don't likethe wav file loading and though I didn't here anything windows prompted mefor a MP3 decoder, so I presume one of those was loading as well. Some ofthe links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also text basedor smaller gifs and put on the index page. For a minute I didn't know whereto go. ~~~~ Thiswas a neat site.� The site was original and I could tell that Mrs.T certainly seemsto enjoy working on her site.� The graphics were pretty, or funny, dependingon each one, but well arranged. But, the text on the home page wasgoing from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlapped theleft rose border. I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.�Also, I think usinga sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did likehow thefont color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internet explorer. Idon't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guide page,it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts, interactiveopinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site to thesite content helps when new visitors visit. Onyour home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics. Ifyou do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showing differentpictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the same pictureon each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website.On yourarticles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics because ofthe background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the background behindthat would work better. Lookfor a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have checked out more pagesbut I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page. Iwent to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is mucheasier todeal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there. ~~~~ Thisis an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not allof which Ivisited - and it has something for every member of the family, however,most ofit is for either mothers or the kids. She even has some games to play -good forsmaller kids, too! Mrs. T., as she is known, is quite creative - and Iwould recommendthis site for the whole family. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ VOTEON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!

Important Message! <regal3@freeuk.com>,Your Shop web site is NOT being SEEN!,"Fri, 26 Jul 2002 04:54:06 +0200","Your Shop Web Site is 
NOT Being SEEN
WHY? 
NO ONE CAN FIND IT!

YOUR web site is NOT on many search engines and at the Bottom of their listings and as a result

YOU are LOSING customers who cannot find you!

Can this be changed? YES!
Regal Telecom 
For ONLY £79.97

We will submit your web site to over 350 of the worlds search engines.
(see full list of Search Engines at the end of this document)

We will submit your site with the most effective meta tags and keywords. 
(See our money back guarantee) 

We know what the search engines are looking for.

How do we know? We look at the top five web sites in your category and use the same meta tags and key words that they use.

If it works for them it will work for you!

So YOUR web site can be
FOUND and SEEN

For Twelve Months! Guaranteed! 

 (See our testimonials)


Think about it!
Just as you have a web designer to build your site and a company to host your site,does it not make sense to use a company that specializes in professionally submitting your web site. 
Getting your web site FOUND and SEEN!


 A Shocking Fact!
Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site seen!  Yes, they may submit your site to a few search engines periodically but to stay on the TOP of the search engines is an aggressive business.

Getting onto the search engines and at the top of their listings doesn't  just happen.

You have to be put there!

What the.Net, The Internet Magazine 8/2000 said:
""You have your web site designed and have sorted out the maintenance and waiting for the business to roll in, but there's one small problem.... No one knows!""

You need a professional company to do it!

Your Money Back
Guarantee! 
If you do not receive confirmation from the search engines that we submit your web site to, we will give you your money back! Guaranteed!

There is nothing to lose!

 thereafter for the next year.

The results will astound you!

Most of your competition are unaware of the facts below!
This is to YOUR Advantage!


Web Site Facts
Remember ""The Yellow Pages"" Rule! 
 A search engine is like an enormous ""yellow pages"" with thousands of companies advertising the same product.  Unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.  Unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the ""Yellow pages"" in the world.

What does it take to be seen on the 
Search Engines?

Appreciate the Three Golden Rules
q Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom! 
q Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on).
q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines! 
Use the right ones and you go up.
Get it wrong and you go to the bottom!
Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines. 
Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried.  Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased. 

It is essential to be on them!

Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need. 
 This can make the difference between new customers 
FINDING your web site or NOT!

Be on ALL of these

Getting your web site FOUND and SEEN!    A Shocking Fact! Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site seen!

A search engine is like an enormous ""yellow pages"" with thousands of companies advertising the same product.  Unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.  Unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the ""Yellow pages"" in the world.  What does it take to be seen on the  Search Engines?  Appreciate the Three Golden Rules q Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom!  q Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on). q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines!  Use the right ones and you go up. Get it wrong and you go to the bottom! Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines.  Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried.  Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased.   It is essential to be on them!  Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need.   This can make the difference between new customers  FINDING your web site or NOT!

I also have received both the virus and email on how to get 
rid of it.  Luckily I don't open ANY attachments, unless I'm 
expecting them and then am still very careful.  

Here's the ways I was told to get rid of the thing:

One Fix Tool:

Download fix_sircam.com and run the file. It will scan Drive
C:\ and subfolders and runs in DOS.
http://www.antivirus.com/vinfo/security/fix_sircam.com

Another Trojan Fix Tool
http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/FixSirc.com
The fix tool will run from your desktop and will ""automatically"" 
rid your computer from the SirCam Trojan and clean up an 
entries from your registry files.

After running either fix tool -- reboot your system.

Hope this helps!

Dear Nicety,

As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking 
up your computer I'm afraid your ""SOL"" as finding a true solution.  
There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts 
resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many 
programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working 
in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a 
regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened 
and closed several different applications.

Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional,
wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating
system vs Windows NT.  You can read it at 
http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is 
even truer today.  Every current ""worm"" you are hearing about 
on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems. 

 So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change 
the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of 
weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running 
I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over. 
I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and 
the price is right -- free.

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #140:  http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com/masterminding
Margarete
MDegaston@aol.com
~~~~

I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate 
sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well 
presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been 
a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site, 
preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a 
relationship to it.

What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something 
related to the url  ""prosperouswomen"" to come up, as this 
""word"" was what caught my attention and caused me to 
click in the first place.

I feel the book page should be a tool for the ""PW"" page and 
not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the 
book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page.
(You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)

With these:

Find out how you can receive the free book.
Email us at directions4U@aol.com        
and
For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing 
write to us at directions4U@aol.com

I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than 
copy and paste.

Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them. 
(and I have ordered the book!)
~~~~

I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.  
Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics 
or where we were headed.
~~~~

Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.

Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish 
between the links and that which is not.

I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also 
linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that 
link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.

If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a 
request message to an aol email address you would get more 
requests, and also might be able to automate this process.
~~~~

I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point.
It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.  
If only other sites we so simplistic!
~~~~

With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact 
on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences 
in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box 
with ""Life Changeing Insight"" needs the 'e' taken out of 
'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended 
to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100 
year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of 
using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where 
or how or by whom it was discovered.

The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that 
would make the site more effective (on getting people to request 
the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in 
what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to 
order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form 
for this just about anywhere.

Dear Nicety,  As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking  up your computer I'm afraid your ""SOL"" as finding a true solution.   There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts  resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many  programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working  in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a  regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened  and closed several different applications.  Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional, wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating system vs Windows NT.  You can read it at  http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is  even truer today.  Every current ""worm"" you are hearing about  on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems.    So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change  the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of  weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running  I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over.  I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and  the price is right -- free.

Comments on Site #140:  http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com/masterminding Margarete MDegaston@aol.com ~~~~  I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate  sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well  presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been  a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site,  preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a  relationship to it.  What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something  related to the url  ""prosperouswomen"" to come up, as this  ""word"" was what caught my attention and caused me to  click in the first place.  I feel the book page should be a tool for the ""PW"" page and  not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the  book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page. (You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)  With these:  Find out how you can receive the free book. Email us at directions4U@aol.com         and For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing  write to us at directions4U@aol.com  I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than  copy and paste.  Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them.  (and I have ordered the book!) ~~~~  I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.   Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics  or where we were headed. ~~~~  Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.  Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish  between the links and that which is not.  I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also  linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that  link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.  If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a  request message to an aol email address you would get more  requests, and also might be able to automate this process. ~~~~  I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point. It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.   If only other sites we so simplistic! ~~~~  With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact  on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences  in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box  with ""Life Changeing Insight"" needs the 'e' taken out of  'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended  to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100  year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of  using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where  or how or by whom it was discovered.  The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that  would make the site more effective (on getting people to request  the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in  what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to  order instead of emailing.

32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any Webpage
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= It's true. Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.  They'll tell you it's true.  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.  They'll agree 100% that it's true.  Don't just take my word for it. In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that it is absolutely true. It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.  Really, they can.  But, it takes several very important components to join the 5% who are successful on the web. One of those necessities is a website. Now, your website does one of two things... ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't. For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do not produce results. And there is a very simple reason for poor performance. Poor sales letters. Does your website convince people to make a purchase? If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into your sales letter... 1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind. Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your sales letter to.  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your next door neighbor or your cat.  Write your sales letter just like you are writing it to them personally.  Why? Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind. Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going to be read to an audience rather than one person.  Keep your sales letters personal, because one person at a time is going to read them. 2) Use an illustration to get your point across.  In my sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback across Montana on a grizzly bear.  Leads have read of how getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home a solid message.  Tell stories that illustrate a point you are trying to make.  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an account from the ""real world.""  It effectively creates interest and further establishes the point. 3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first line.  Your first line of the sales letter should immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know more.  Go back to the beginning of this article.  The first words were, ""It's true.""  I can guarantee you that either consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?"" Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking about.  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8 paragraphs into this article.  Carefully craft your first line.  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more, you've got a winner. 4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer. Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight each line and create a sense of more length to the list. 5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.  Shortly after your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet list of benefits to absorb.  Hit them with your best shot. Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most important things the reader will discover.  By offering a killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad copy.  After all, if they are already interested after the first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to finding out even more reasons why your product or service will aid them. 6) Just let it all flow out.  Write down everything that enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You can edit it later.  If you just sit and start writing everything you know about your product or service and how it will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much information floods your mind.  Write it ALL down.  Then read through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to many of the points.  Edit it after you have exhausted all of your ideas. 7) Make your sales letter personal.  Make sure that the words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my."" Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not yourself.  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes, but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""  Leads aren't interested in you or your products, they are interested in themselves and their wants and needs.  When you are finished with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to ""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.  It's a free service.  Make sure it's at least 4:1 in favor of the customer. 8) Write like you speak.  Forget all of those rules that your grammar teacher taught you.  Write your sales letters in everyday language, just like you would talk in person. Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because."" Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition. Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest Hemingway. 9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each. Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.  Use short paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be afraid to use short sentences.  Like this one. Or this. See what I mean?  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often force the reader to get distracted. 10)  Stress the benefits, not the features.  Again, readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it for  me?""  What need is it going to meet? What want is it going to fill?  How is your product or service going to be of value or benefit to the reader?  Spell it out.  Don't focus on the features of your product or service , but rather how those features will add value to the life of your reader. For example:  If you are selling automobile tires, you may very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world, but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while we are traveling.  So, instead of focusing on your selection, you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress the benefits, not the features. 11) Keep the reader interested.  Some sales letters read like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to understand.  Unless you are writing to a very targeted audience, avoid using technical language that many readers might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language and information that are easy to understand and follow. 12) Target your sales letter.  When you are finished with your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a specific audience.  For example: If you are selling a ""work at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards women who are homemakers.  Then, rewrite the same sales letter and target it to college students.  Write another letter targeting senior citizens.  Still another could be written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income during summer vacation.  The possibilities are endless. All you need to do is add a few words here and there in your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only 5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only 5 hours a week.""  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website (you could easily target 100's of groups). Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted mediums.  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page in a campus ezine.  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be advertised at a retirement community message board. By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product to.  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a match made for them. 13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.  Use short sentences and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One thing that I have always found to work very well in sales letters... ...is to use a pause like this. Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also, if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK HERE to continue."" 14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.  When the customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark."" If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat that let the mouse get away.""  Use words to create a picture in the readers' mind.  When you think of Superman, what comes to mind?  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster than a speeding bullet.""  ""More powerful than a locomotive."" ""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how word pictures stick in our minds? 15) Focus on one product or service.  Don't try to sell your customer multiple products at the same time. It only confuses the reader.  Keep your ad copy directed at one specific product or service.  Then, use other products and services as back-end products. 16) Make it stand out.  Don't kid yourself.  There are hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the same thing you are doing.  How will you stand out among the crowd?  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must breathe of originality.  Your product or service is different. It's not like all of the rest.  It is unique. Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the competition.  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find this anywhere else."" 17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!"" Delete.  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or something?  Get real.  Don't make outrageous claims that are obviously not the truth.  You'll ruin your reputation. Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be reversed.  Once you have been branded a liar, you will NEVER be anything but a liar.  It doesn't matter if you launch the most respectable, honest business available anywhere, people will always have doubt because they remember the crazy stuff you've said before.  Be believable. Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth. 18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but rather be EXACT.  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's mind.  ""What am I really getting here?  Does he even know?"" When you use specific information, the reader begins to think, ""This person must have counted.  I know exactly what I can expect.""  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They leave no impression whatsoever."" 19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would want to know about your product or service.  Answer all of their questions, anything they would want to consider before making a purchase.  Think about it from their point of view. Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""  Then, address that in your sales letter.  Remove anything that would keep the reader from making the purchase. 20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.  Share actual excerpts from what your current customers are saying about your product or service. Many websites have an entire section or even a separate page that has endorsements and compliments listed.  Satisfied customers remove some of the doubt in the mind of the reader.  ""If these people have found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I probably will too.""  Especially effective are testimonials from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target field. 21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter. A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your ad copy.  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.  A well- placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.  They are that important. 22) Avoid asking stupid questions.  ""Wouldn't you like to make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would you like to be as successful as I am?""  Avoid any question that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them feel like they are inferior. 23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy. If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try to influence them to buy in the future.  By offering a free item, you can  request their email address in order to obtain the freebie.  By doing this, you can now follow-up with the customer for a potential future sale. Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item. And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful product or service which impresses the customer, they probably will be back as a customer soon. 24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.  One of the things that I have found very effective in writing sales letters is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product I am offering.  Ginsu made this one famous. They were selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages the credibility of your main offer. 25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more"" and ""But that's not all.""  These phrases effectively lead the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or leads into bonus items.  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE value and benefits to the reader. 26) Always include a deadline.  By including a deadline, you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer. ""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the bonuses.""  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining, I've got to hurry.""  Let the customer know what they will be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember, they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines are very effective.  Every sales letter should have one. 27) Tell them exactly how to order.  Be clear as to the order process. Point them towards the order link.  Tell them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks, etc.)  Make this process as simple and clear as can be. If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue. 28)  Explain when the product will be delivered.  How quickly will the order be processed?  When will the order be available?  Let the customer know exactly what they can expect when they place their order.  The more specific you can be here, the better.  Let them know that you have a system in place.  ""Operators are standing by.""  Their order will be handled properly.  Tell them. 29) Offer a money back guarantee.  Take away their last reason to hold back.  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day guarantee.  Most people may not realize this, but in most cases, it's the law of the land.  You are REQUIRED to give them their money back if they are not satisfied with the product or service.  Since it's the law anyway, why not make it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your product or service RISK-FREE. 30) Instruct them to respond immediately.  Many people just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""  ""Order today!"" ""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""  You've got them this far, now tell them what you want them to do.  Get them to ""Act Fast!""  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right way? 31) Include a post script.  People will always read the P.S.  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT parts of your sales letter. Why?  Because in many cases the visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.  A P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed description of what they will receive for their money. Use your P.S. to restate your offer in detail. 32) Include a second post script.  You better believe if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.  Use this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would make them want to order.  I guarantee you they will read it. Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see a significant increase in the amount of responses you receive from your sales letters.  In fact, it would be impossible for your responses to not improve.

Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.  They'll tell you it's true.  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.  They'll agree 100% that it's true.  Don't just take my word for it. In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that it is absolutely true. It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.  Really, they can.  But, it takes several very important components to join the 5% who are successful on the web. One of those necessities is a website. Now, your website does one of two things... ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't. For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do not produce results. And there is a very simple reason for poor performance. Poor sales letters. Does your website convince people to make a purchase? If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into your sales letter... 1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind. Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your sales letter to.  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your next door neighbor or your cat.  Write your sales letter just like you are writing it to them personally.  Why? Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind. Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going to be read to an audience rather than one person.  Keep your sales letters personal, because one person at a time is going to read them. 2) Use an illustration to get your point across.  In my sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback across Montana on a grizzly bear.  Leads have read of how getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home a solid message.  Tell stories that illustrate a point you are trying to make.  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an account from the ""real world.""  It effectively creates interest and further establishes the point. 3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first line.  Your first line of the sales letter should immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know more.  Go back to the beginning of this article.  The first words were, ""It's true.""  I can guarantee you that either consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?"" Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking about.  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8 paragraphs into this article.  Carefully craft your first line.  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more, you've got a winner. 4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer. Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight each line and create a sense of more length to the list. 5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.  Shortly after your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet list of benefits to absorb.  Hit them with your best shot. Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most important things the reader will discover.  By offering a killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad copy.  After all, if they are already interested after the first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to finding out even more reasons why your product or service will aid them. 6) Just let it all flow out.  Write down everything that enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You can edit it later.  If you just sit and start writing everything you know about your product or service and how it will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much information floods your mind.  Write it ALL down.  Then read through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to many of the points.  Edit it after you have exhausted all of your ideas. 7) Make your sales letter personal.  Make sure that the words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my."" Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not yourself.  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes, but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""  Leads aren't interested in you or your products, they are interested in themselves and their wants and needs.  When you are finished with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to ""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.  It's a free service.  Make sure it's at least 4:1 in favor of the customer. 8) Write like you speak.  Forget all of those rules that your grammar teacher taught you.  Write your sales letters in everyday language, just like you would talk in person. Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because."" Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition. Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest Hemingway. 9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each. Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.  Use short paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be afraid to use short sentences.  Like this one. Or this. See what I mean?  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often force the reader to get distracted. 10)  Stress the benefits, not the features.  Again, readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it for  me?""  What need is it going to meet? What want is it going to fill?  How is your product or service going to be of value or benefit to the reader?  Spell it out.  Don't focus on the features of your product or service , but rather how those features will add value to the life of your reader. For example:  If you are selling automobile tires, you may very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world, but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while we are traveling.  So, instead of focusing on your selection, you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress the benefits, not the features. 11) Keep the reader interested.  Some sales letters read like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to understand.  Unless you are writing to a very targeted audience, avoid using technical language that many readers might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language and information that are easy to understand and follow. 12) Target your sales letter.  When you are finished with your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a specific audience.  For example: If you are selling a ""work at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards women who are homemakers.  Then, rewrite the same sales letter and target it to college students.  Write another letter targeting senior citizens.  Still another could be written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income during summer vacation.  The possibilities are endless. All you need to do is add a few words here and there in your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only 5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only 5 hours a week.""  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website (you could easily target 100's of groups). Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted mediums.  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page in a campus ezine.  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be advertised at a retirement community message board. By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product to.  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a match made for them. 13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.  Use short sentences and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One thing that I have always found to work very well in sales letters... ...is to use a pause like this. Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also, if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK HERE to continue."" 14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.  When the customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark."" If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat that let the mouse get away.""  Use words to create a picture in the readers' mind.  When you think of Superman, what comes to mind?  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster than a speeding bullet.""  ""More powerful than a locomotive."" ""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how word pictures stick in our minds? 15) Focus on one product or service.  Don't try to sell your customer multiple products at the same time. It only confuses the reader.  Keep your ad copy directed at one specific product or service.  Then, use other products and services as back-end products. 16) Make it stand out.  Don't kid yourself.  There are hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the same thing you are doing.  How will you stand out among the crowd?  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must breathe of originality.  Your product or service is different. It's not like all of the rest.  It is unique. Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the competition.  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find this anywhere else."" 17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!"" Delete.  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or something?  Get real.  Don't make outrageous claims that are obviously not the truth.  You'll ruin your reputation. Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be reversed.  Once you have been branded a liar, you will NEVER be anything but a liar.  It doesn't matter if you launch the most respectable, honest business available anywhere, people will always have doubt because they remember the crazy stuff you've said before.  Be believable. Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth. 18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but rather be EXACT.  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's mind.  ""What am I really getting here?  Does he even know?"" When you use specific information, the reader begins to think, ""This person must have counted.  I know exactly what I can expect.""  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They leave no impression whatsoever."" 19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would want to know about your product or service.  Answer all of their questions, anything they would want to consider before making a purchase.  Think about it from their point of view. Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""  Then, address that in your sales letter.  Remove anything that would keep the reader from making the purchase. 20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.  Share actual excerpts from what your current customers are saying about your product or service. Many websites have an entire section or even a separate page that has endorsements and compliments listed.  Satisfied customers remove some of the doubt in the mind of the reader.  ""If these people have found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I probably will too.""  Especially effective are testimonials from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target field. 21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter. A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your ad copy.  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.  A well- placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.  They are that important. 22) Avoid asking stupid questions.  ""Wouldn't you like to make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would you like to be as successful as I am?""  Avoid any question that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them feel like they are inferior. 23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy. If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try to influence them to buy in the future.  By offering a free item, you can  request their email address in order to obtain the freebie.  By doing this, you can now follow-up with the customer for a potential future sale. Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item. And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful product or service which impresses the customer, they probably will be back as a customer soon. 24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.  One of the things that I have found very effective in writing sales letters is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product I am offering.  Ginsu made this one famous. They were selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages the credibility of your main offer. 25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more"" and ""But that's not all.""  These phrases effectively lead the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or leads into bonus items.  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE value and benefits to the reader. 26) Always include a deadline.  By including a deadline, you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer. ""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the bonuses.""  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining, I've got to hurry.""  Let the customer know what they will be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember, they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines are very effective.  Every sales letter should have one. 27) Tell them exactly how to order.  Be clear as to the order process. Point them towards the order link.  Tell them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks, etc.)  Make this process as simple and clear as can be. If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue. 28)  Explain when the product will be delivered.  How quickly will the order be processed?  When will the order be available?  Let the customer know exactly what they can expect when they place their order.  The more specific you can be here, the better.  Let them know that you have a system in place.  ""Operators are standing by.""  Their order will be handled properly.  Tell them. 29) Offer a money back guarantee.  Take away their last reason to hold back.  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day guarantee.  Most people may not realize this, but in most cases, it's the law of the land.  You are REQUIRED to give them their money back if they are not satisfied with the product or service.  Since it's the law anyway, why not make it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your product or service RISK-FREE. 30) Instruct them to respond immediately.  Many people just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""  ""Order today!"" ""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""  You've got them this far, now tell them what you want them to do.  Get them to ""Act Fast!""  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right way? 31) Include a post script.  People will always read the P.S.  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT parts of your sales letter. Why?  Because in many cases the visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.  A P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed description of what they will receive for their money. Use your P.S. to restate your offer in detail. 32) Include a second post script.  You better believe if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.  Use this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would make them want to order.  I guarantee you they will read it. Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see a significant increase in the amount of responses you receive from your sales letters.  In fact, it would be impossible for your responses to not improve.

Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.  They'll tell you it's true.  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.  They'll agree 100% that it's true.  Don't just take my word for it. In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that it is absolutely true. It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.  Really, they can.  But, it takes several very important components to join the 5% who are successful on the web. One of those necessities is a website. Now, your website does one of two things... ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't. For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do not produce results. And there is a very simple reason for poor performance. Poor sales letters. Does your website convince people to make a purchase? If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into your sales letter... 1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind. Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your sales letter to.  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your next door neighbor or your cat.  Write your sales letter just like you are writing it to them personally.  Why? Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind. Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going to be read to an audience rather than one person.  Keep your sales letters personal, because one person at a time is going to read them. 2) Use an illustration to get your point across.  In my sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback across Montana on a grizzly bear.  Leads have read of how getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home a solid message.  Tell stories that illustrate a point you are trying to make.  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an account from the ""real world.""  It effectively creates interest and further establishes the point. 3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first line.  Your first line of the sales letter should immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know more.  Go back to the beginning of this article.  The first words were, ""It's true.""  I can guarantee you that either consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?"" Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking about.  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8 paragraphs into this article.  Carefully craft your first line.  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more, you've got a winner. 4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer. Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight each line and create a sense of more length to the list. 5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.  Shortly after your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet list of benefits to absorb.  Hit them with your best shot. Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most important things the reader will discover.  By offering a killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad copy.  After all, if they are already interested after the first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to finding out even more reasons why your product or service will aid them. 6) Just let it all flow out.  Write down everything that enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You can edit it later.  If you just sit and start writing everything you know about your product or service and how it will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much information floods your mind.  Write it ALL down.  Then read through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to many of the points.  Edit it after you have exhausted all of your ideas. 7) Make your sales letter personal.  Make sure that the words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my."" Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not yourself.  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes, but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""  Leads aren't interested in you or your products, they are interested in themselves and their wants and needs.  When you are finished with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to ""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.  It's a free service.  Make sure it's at least 4:1 in favor of the customer. 8) Write like you speak.  Forget all of those rules that your grammar teacher taught you.  Write your sales letters in everyday language, just like you would talk in person. Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because."" Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition. Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest Hemingway. 9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each. Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.  Use short paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be afraid to use short sentences.  Like this one. Or this. See what I mean?  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often force the reader to get distracted. 10)  Stress the benefits, not the features.  Again, readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it for  me?""  What need is it going to meet? What want is it going to fill?  How is your product or service going to be of value or benefit to the reader?  Spell it out.  Don't focus on the features of your product or service , but rather how those features will add value to the life of your reader. For example:  If you are selling automobile tires, you may very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world, but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while we are traveling.  So, instead of focusing on your selection, you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress the benefits, not the features. 11) Keep the reader interested.  Some sales letters read like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to understand.  Unless you are writing to a very targeted audience, avoid using technical language that many readers might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language and information that are easy to understand and follow. 12) Target your sales letter.  When you are finished with your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a specific audience.  For example: If you are selling a ""work at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards women who are homemakers.  Then, rewrite the same sales letter and target it to college students.  Write another letter targeting senior citizens.  Still another could be written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income during summer vacation.  The possibilities are endless. All you need to do is add a few words here and there in your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only 5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only 5 hours a week.""  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website (you could easily target 100's of groups). Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted mediums.  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page in a campus ezine.  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be advertised at a retirement community message board. By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product to.  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a match made for them. 13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.  Use short sentences and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One thing that I have always found to work very well in sales letters... ...is to use a pause like this. Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also, if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK HERE to continue."" 14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.  When the customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark."" If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat that let the mouse get away.""  Use words to create a picture in the readers' mind.  When you think of Superman, what comes to mind?  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster than a speeding bullet.""  ""More powerful than a locomotive."" ""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how word pictures stick in our minds? 15) Focus on one product or service.  Don't try to sell your customer multiple products at the same time. It only confuses the reader.  Keep your ad copy directed at one specific product or service.  Then, use other products and services as back-end products. 16) Make it stand out.  Don't kid yourself.  There are hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the same thing you are doing.  How will you stand out among the crowd?  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must breathe of originality.  Your product or service is different. It's not like all of the rest.  It is unique. Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the competition.  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find this anywhere else."" 17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!"" Delete.  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or something?  Get real.  Don't make outrageous claims that are obviously not the truth.  You'll ruin your reputation. Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be reversed.  Once you have been branded a liar, you will NEVER be anything but a liar.  It doesn't matter if you launch the most respectable, honest business available anywhere, people will always have doubt because they remember the crazy stuff you've said before.  Be believable. Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth. 18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but rather be EXACT.  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's mind.  ""What am I really getting here?  Does he even know?"" When you use specific information, the reader begins to think, ""This person must have counted.  I know exactly what I can expect.""  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They leave no impression whatsoever."" 19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would want to know about your product or service.  Answer all of their questions, anything they would want to consider before making a purchase.  Think about it from their point of view. Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""  Then, address that in your sales letter.  Remove anything that would keep the reader from making the purchase. 20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.  Share actual excerpts from what your current customers are saying about your product or service. Many websites have an entire section or even a separate page that has endorsements and compliments listed.  Satisfied customers remove some of the doubt in the mind of the reader.  ""If these people have found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I probably will too.""  Especially effective are testimonials from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target field. 21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter. A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your ad copy.  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.  A well- placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.  They are that important. 22) Avoid asking stupid questions.  ""Wouldn't you like to make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would you like to be as successful as I am?""  Avoid any question that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them feel like they are inferior. 23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy. If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try to influence them to buy in the future.  By offering a free item, you can  request their email address in order to obtain the freebie.  By doing this, you can now follow-up with the customer for a potential future sale. Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item. And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful product or service which impresses the customer, they probably will be back as a customer soon. 24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.  One of the things that I have found very effective in writing sales letters is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product I am offering.  Ginsu made this one famous. They were selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages the credibility of your main offer. 25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more"" and ""But that's not all.""  These phrases effectively lead the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or leads into bonus items.  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE value and benefits to the reader. 26) Always include a deadline.  By including a deadline, you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer. ""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the bonuses.""  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining, I've got to hurry.""  Let the customer know what they will be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember, they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines are very effective.  Every sales letter should have one. 27) Tell them exactly how to order.  Be clear as to the order process. Point them towards the order link.  Tell them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks, etc.)  Make this process as simple and clear as can be. If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue. 28)  Explain when the product will be delivered.  How quickly will the order be processed?  When will the order be available?  Let the customer know exactly what they can expect when they place their order.  The more specific you can be here, the better.  Let them know that you have a system in place.  ""Operators are standing by.""  Their order will be handled properly.  Tell them. 29) Offer a money back guarantee.  Take away their last reason to hold back.  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day guarantee.  Most people may not realize this, but in most cases, it's the law of the land.  You are REQUIRED to give them their money back if they are not satisfied with the product or service.  Since it's the law anyway, why not make it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your product or service RISK-FREE. 30) Instruct them to respond immediately.  Many people just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""  ""Order today!"" ""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""  You've got them this far, now tell them what you want them to do.  Get them to ""Act Fast!""  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right way? 31) Include a post script.  People will always read the P.S.  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT parts of your sales letter. Why?  Because in many cases the visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.  A P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed description of what they will receive for their money. Use your P.S. to restate your offer in detail. 32) Include a second post script.  You better believe if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.  Use this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would make them want to order.  I guarantee you they will read it. Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see a significant increase in the amount of responses you receive from your sales letters.  In fact, it would be impossible for your responses to not improve.

Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going to be read to an audience rather than one person.  Keep your sales letters personal, because one person at a time is going to read them. 2) Use an illustration to get your point across.  In my sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback across Montana on a grizzly bear.  Leads have read of how getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home a solid message.  Tell stories that illustrate a point you are trying to make.  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an account from the ""real world.""  It effectively creates interest and further establishes the point. 3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first line.  Your first line of the sales letter should immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know more.  Go back to the beginning of this article.  The first words were, ""It's true.""  I can guarantee you that either consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?"" Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking about.  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8 paragraphs into this article.  Carefully craft your first line.  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more, you've got a winner. 4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer. Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight each line and create a sense of more length to the list. 5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.  Shortly after your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet list of benefits to absorb.  Hit them with your best shot. Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most important things the reader will discover.  By offering a killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad copy.  After all, if they are already interested after the first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to finding out even more reasons why your product or service will aid them. 6) Just let it all flow out.  Write down everything that enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You can edit it later.  If you just sit and start writing everything you know about your product or service and how it will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much information floods your mind.  Write it ALL down.  Then read through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to many of the points.  Edit it after you have exhausted all of your ideas. 7) Make your sales letter personal.  Make sure that the words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my."" Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not yourself.  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes, but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""  Leads aren't interested in you or your products, they are interested in themselves and their wants and needs.  When you are finished with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to ""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.  It's a free service.  Make sure it's at least 4:1 in favor of the customer. 8) Write like you speak.  Forget all of those rules that your grammar teacher taught you.  Write your sales letters in everyday language, just like you would talk in person. Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because."" Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition. Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest Hemingway. 9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each. Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.  Use short paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be afraid to use short sentences.  Like this one. Or this. See what I mean?  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often force the reader to get distracted. 10)  Stress the benefits, not the features.  Again, readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it for  me?""  What need is it going to meet? What want is it going to fill?  How is your product or service going to be of value or benefit to the reader?  Spell it out.  Don't focus on the features of your product or service , but rather how those features will add value to the life of your reader. For example:  If you are selling automobile tires, you may very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world, but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while we are traveling.  So, instead of focusing on your selection, you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress the benefits, not the features. 11) Keep the reader interested.  Some sales letters read like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to understand.  Unless you are writing to a very targeted audience, avoid using technical language that many readers might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language and information that are easy to understand and follow. 12) Target your sales letter.  When you are finished with your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a specific audience.  For example: If you are selling a ""work at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards women who are homemakers.  Then, rewrite the same sales letter and target it to college students.  Write another letter targeting senior citizens.  Still another could be written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income during summer vacation.  The possibilities are endless. All you need to do is add a few words here and there in your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only 5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only 5 hours a week.""  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website (you could easily target 100's of groups). Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted mediums.  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page in a campus ezine.  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be advertised at a retirement community message board. By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product to.  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a match made for them. 13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.  Use short sentences and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One thing that I have always found to work very well in sales letters... ...is to use a pause like this. Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also, if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK HERE to continue."" 14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.  When the customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark."" If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat that let the mouse get away.""  Use words to create a picture in the readers' mind.  When you think of Superman, what comes to mind?  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster than a speeding bullet.""  ""More powerful than a locomotive."" ""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how word pictures stick in our minds? 15) Focus on one product or service.  Don't try to sell your customer multiple products at the same time. It only confuses the reader.  Keep your ad copy directed at one specific product or service.  Then, use other products and services as back-end products. 16) Make it stand out.  Don't kid yourself.  There are hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the same thing you are doing.  How will you stand out among the crowd?  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must breathe of originality.  Your product or service is different. It's not like all of the rest.  It is unique. Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the competition.  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find this anywhere else."" 17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!"" Delete.  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or something?  Get real.  Don't make outrageous claims that are obviously not the truth.  You'll ruin your reputation. Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be reversed.  Once you have been branded a liar, you will NEVER be anything but a liar.  It doesn't matter if you launch the most respectable, honest business available anywhere, people will always have doubt because they remember the crazy stuff you've said before.  Be believable. Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth. 18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but rather be EXACT.  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's mind.  ""What am I really getting here?  Does he even know?"" When you use specific information, the reader begins to think, ""This person must have counted.  I know exactly what I can expect.""  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They leave no impression whatsoever."" 19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would want to know about your product or service.  Answer all of their questions, anything they would want to consider before making a purchase.  Think about it from their point of view. Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""  Then, address that in your sales letter.  Remove anything that would keep the reader from making the purchase. 20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.  Share actual excerpts from what your current customers are saying about your product or service. Many websites have an entire section or even a separate page that has endorsements and compliments listed.  Satisfied customers remove some of the doubt in the mind of the reader.  ""If these people have found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I probably will too.""  Especially effective are testimonials from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target field. 21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter. A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your ad copy.  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.  A well- placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.  They are that important. 22) Avoid asking stupid questions.  ""Wouldn't you like to make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would you like to be as successful as I am?""  Avoid any question that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them feel like they are inferior. 23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy. If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try to influence them to buy in the future.  By offering a free item, you can  request their email address in order to obtain the freebie.  By doing this, you can now follow-up with the customer for a potential future sale. Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item. And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful product or service which impresses the customer, they probably will be back as a customer soon. 24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.  One of the things that I have found very effective in writing sales letters is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product I am offering.  Ginsu made this one famous. They were selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages the credibility of your main offer. 25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more"" and ""But that's not all.""  These phrases effectively lead the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or leads into bonus items.  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE value and benefits to the reader. 26) Always include a deadline.  By including a deadline, you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer. ""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the bonuses.""  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining, I've got to hurry.""  Let the customer know what they will be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember, they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines are very effective.  Every sales letter should have one. 27) Tell them exactly how to order.  Be clear as to the order process. Point them towards the order link.  Tell them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks, etc.)  Make this process as simple and clear as can be. If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue. 28)  Explain when the product will be delivered.  How quickly will the order be processed?  When will the order be available?  Let the customer know exactly what they can expect when they place their order.  The more specific you can be here, the better.  Let them know that you have a system in place.  ""Operators are standing by.""  Their order will be handled properly.  Tell them. 29) Offer a money back guarantee.  Take away their last reason to hold back.  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day guarantee.  Most people may not realize this, but in most cases, it's the law of the land.  You are REQUIRED to give them their money back if they are not satisfied with the product or service.  Since it's the law anyway, why not make it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your product or service RISK-FREE. 30) Instruct them to respond immediately.  Many people just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""  ""Order today!"" ""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""  You've got them this far, now tell them what you want them to do.  Get them to ""Act Fast!""  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right way? 31) Include a post script.  People will always read the P.S.  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT parts of your sales letter. Why?  Because in many cases the visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.  A P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed description of what they will receive for their money. Use your P.S. to restate your offer in detail. 32) Include a second post script.  You better believe if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.  Use this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would make them want to order.  I guarantee you they will read it. Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see a significant increase in the amount of responses you receive from your sales letters.  In fact, it would be impossible for your responses to not improve.

EMAIL FAX: 1 561 619 2791
EMAIL:mrjoemark@yahoo.com

DEAR SIR
 
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP � STRICTLY
CONFIDENTIAL.
 
Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and �TOP SECRET.� Though
I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make
anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you
that all will be well at the end of the day. 

We have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we
decided it is best using the email. Let me start by
first introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr.
Kaku Opa, a director general in the Ministry 
of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man tender board
appointed by the Government of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria to award contracts to individuals and
companies and to approve such contract payments in the
Ministry of Mines and Power. The duties of the
committee also include evaluation, vetting and
monitoring of work done by foreign and local
contractors in the ministry.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. 

The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. 

However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million
dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United
States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. 

The Federal Government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.

We need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are
handicapped 
in the circumstances as the civil service code of
conduct, does not allow us to operate off-shore
accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction. 

My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. 

It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. We are civil servants and we will not want
to miss this once in a life time opportunity.

You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. We have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: 

(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. 

(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. 

(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. 

(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. 

Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten
Bank working days from the date of  receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. 

Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my email
address mrjoemark@yahoo.com. I will bring you into
the
complete picture of the transaction when I have heard
from you. 

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. 

Thank you and God bless. 

Yours faithfully, 

Mr Joe Mark

For your kind attention,


              REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.

I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Compan!
y.

Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.


Yours Faithfully

bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way, after-the-fact !
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down ( I have been self-employed all my life ), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment ( great! because
I had none ) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if ( when ) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics. This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know:  Whats it all about ? and  How
does it work ?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines:  Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life  yeah, right! I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the

lworks1@hotmail.com,Attn: How about being a few pounds lighter?OLIBYKN,"Thu, 29 Aug 2002 19:56:38 -1600","How are you doing?

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

"""Dr. Osaro Ame"" <osa_ame2001@yahoo.com>",PARTNERSHIP REQUEST,"Mon, 06 May 2002 15:13:11 -0700","REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP 

Dear Sir,
 
Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and �TOP SECRET.� 
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. 

We have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we
decided it is best using the email. 

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you. I am Dr. Osaro Ame, a director general in the
Ministry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man
tender board appointed by the Government of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts to
individuals and companies and to approve such contract
payments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. The
duties of the committee also include evaluation,
vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign
and local contractors in the ministry.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. 

The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. 

However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million
dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United
States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. 

The Federal Government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.

We need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are
handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service
code of conduct, does not allow us to operate
off-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction is highly needed . 

My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. 

It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. We are civil servants and we will not
want to miss this once in a life time opportunity.

You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. We have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: 

(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. 

(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. 

(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. 

(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. 

Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten
Bank working days from the date of receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. 

Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1-443-658-2542 or my email
address and I will bring you into the complete picture
of this transaction when I have heard from you. 

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. 

Thank you and God bless. 

Yours faithfully, 

Dr. Osaro Ame

Wayne <lwharris@flash.net>,Try It Free Before You  Buy!,"Sun, 28 Jul 2002 19:22:05 -0500","Hi !

My name is Wayne Harrison and I would like to share a
genuine, NO RISK opportunity with you.

What I have to share with you is not like any other internet
opportunities you have seen before. It is first and foremost
a CONSUMER OPPORTUNITY.

It also offers you the ability to have a share of a
new Internet Mall to buy at wholesale for yourself
or to send others and make commissions on their
purchases.

Besides this, it also offers a unique networking program
using a principle we call ""REFERNET"" Marketing. This is no
""get rich quick"" scheme, but rather a credible
and realistic way to save money and gradually develop
what can become a large, recurring residual income.

What's the best thing about this opportunity?
You can ""try it before you buy it"". That's right.
You can join the DHS Club for FREE with no risk
or obligation. 

Make sure and check out the DHS Club's own ISP, ClubDepot.com.
You'll get Unlimited Internet Access for only $14.95 / month! Included
are 5 email addresses and 5 MB web space.

To get your free membership and to learn more about
the DHS Club and our exciting REFERNET Marketing
Program and Postlaunch, visit my web page at

5 Ways to Create a Unique Website
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design. This is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites. These
five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design
for your website.

1. Navigation System

Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase 
(http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. There is a list 
of categories on the left, and information about the network 
on the top bar.

It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:

- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets
   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.

2. Color Scheme

When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For
example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white.

A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer
(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by Aaron
Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles 
(http://www.freewarefiles.com), Tucows (http://www.tucows.com),
or Download.com (http://www.download.com) for ""color schemer.""

3. Content Window

This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand.

Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what 
you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write
your own content, it sure is worth it.

To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). Other people may
have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the
authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be
careful though. Do not use too much content from other 
authors, as mentioned above.

4. Font(s)

Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)

Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be 
used for long pieces of text.

The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it
easier to read.

5. Advertising

Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing 
that almost every website has. The most common type is what 
is known as ""banner"" advertising. It is called that because it is 
long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The 
generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.

New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new
style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it looks
like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too
wide (about 100-125 pixels.)

Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners 
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.
Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.

    Conclusion

These are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know what 
you find that helps you create a unique website. My email

This is often because webmasters do not have the ability or time to design and create unique websites. These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design for your website. 1. Navigation System Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first things to consider when designing your website. Visitors usually look for a way to get to the information they want before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase ( http://www.webmasterbase.com ) for example. There is a list of categories on the left, and information about the network on the top bar. It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the bottom of the page because: - People see the top of the page first - If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor. 2. Color Scheme When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some colors that are often used are white on black or black on white. A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer ( http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/ ), created by Aaron Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles ( http://www.freewarefiles.com ), Tucows ( http://www.tucows.com ), or Download.com ( http://www.download.com ) for ""color schemer."" 3. Content Window This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here is easy to read and understand. Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write your own content, it sure is worth it. To find content for your website, try searching at EzineArticles ( http://www.ezinearticles.com ). Other people may have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be careful though. Do not use too much content from other authors, as mentioned above. 4. Font(s) Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New. Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.) Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be used for long pieces of text. The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs, or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times (Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif, is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it easier to read. 5. Advertising Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing that almost every website has. The most common type is what is known as ""banner"" advertising. It is called that because it is long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high. New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it looks like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too wide (about 100-125 pixels.) Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.  Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle of the page, at the bottom, or along the side. Conclusion These are only five things to consider when designing a website. There are many others however. Let me know what you find that helps you create a unique website.

BARRISTER JOHNSON AKERELE <adewale1@mail.com>,REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE,"Mon, 22 Jul 2002 14:35:46 -0700","BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER CHAMBERS
Legal Practitioners / Notary Public
Blk 804- Law House Building
Lagos-Nigeria.

For your kind attention,


              REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.

I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.

Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.


Yours Faithfully

BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
By Michael E. Angier

This is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at
present. Consider them suggestions for yourself--ideas to 
help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear 
on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be 
moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.


1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
have even more to appreciate.

2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize 
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. 
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly 
imagine.

3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.

4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and 
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more 
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.

5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.

6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.

7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.

8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of 
my book, then write in my journal.

9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, 
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.

10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.

Bonus Step: Make something work better -- 
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

Last Weeks's Survey Results & Comments  (07/27/01)

 ~~~ Are you concerned about identity theft online? ~~~

yes   81%
no    19%

Comments:
~~~~~~~~~

No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  

We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  

The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.
--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html
~~~~~~~~~

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. 

Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com 
~~~~~~~~~

Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

Reflect upon the things in my life for which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will have even more to appreciate. 2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly imagine. 3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals. 4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more calories. Eat only small amounts at one time. 5. Read something educational, inspirational or entertaining--preferably all three. 6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the Super-conscious. 7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy. 8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of my book, then write in my journal. 9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible. 10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.

Last Weeks's Survey Results & Comments  (07/27/01) ~~~ Are you concerned about identity theft online? ~~~ yes   81% no    19% Comments: ~~~~~~~~~ No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address and about 90% of the time I can get the number. We are so worried about putting our credit card number on the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that person (me) would have her account info and could write a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her to tell me what the difference was between the original check and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never heard back from her. The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is available in many places.  Have a good day. --  Terry http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html ~~~~~~~~~ Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most importantly, never give any personal information at a site that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar or a Veri secure sign or others. Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put in my credit information in each time instead of having an account in standing, a little more time but less risks involved!

I recently came across a copy of your resume I found on the 
internet. In case you're back on the market, you should check
out this new web service that instantly posts your resume to
over 75 career websites.

You fill out one online form and immediately you can be seen
by over 1.5 million employers and recruiters daily! It works.

In about 15 minutes you'll be posted to all the major sites
like: Monster, CareerBuilder, HotJobs, Dice, Job.com and
more. It'll save you 60 hours in research and data entry.

Check out http://start.resumerabbit.com - I think you'll
like it. You don't even need a current resume.

It's a tough job market right now. So if you've got a good
job hold on to it. But these days it's smart to have a few
irons in the fire too. That only happens by being in all the
right places at all the right times. So even if you do it by
hand, get maximum exposure and be found on as many career
sites as possible.

Just food for thought!

"""Dr.James Ologun"" <jamesalabi@mail.com>",Immediate Reply Needed,"Sat, 24 Aug 2002 20:18:02 -0700","Dear Sir,

I am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contract
award and review committee set up by the federal
government of Nigeria under the new civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge
sum of money to a foreign account. 

There were series of contracts executed by a 
consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in
favor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these 
contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum
of US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand 
United
State Dollars). This amount has now been approved and
is now ready to be transferred being that the
companies
that actually executed these contracts have been
fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. 


Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to 
transfer the total amount to your account for
subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants
are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil
service law) from operating and/or opening foreign 
accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in 
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 
transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for
incidental expenses (internal and external) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will
be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts
in due course. 

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of 
Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds
within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of
the above stated terms. 
Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To 

accord this transaction the legality it deserves and
for mutual security of the funds the whole approval
procedures will officially and legally processed
with your name or the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonefide beneficiary. 
Once more I want you to understand that having put
in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my
country, I am averse to having my image and career 
dented. This matter should therefore be treated with
utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. 

Please you should signify your intention to assist
by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this
transaction, if favorable we will take further steps
to brief you the full details of this viable 
transaction. 
I want to assure you that this business proposal is
100% risk free as we have done our homework
properly. 

I quite believe that you will protect our interest
by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are
still in government service, which we intend to
retire from in full honor.

Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the next batch
which would constitute the new quarter payments
for the 2002 financial year. 

Thank you and God bless.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of  Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms.  Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To   accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary.  Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career  dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves.   Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this transaction, if favorable we will take further steps to brief you the full details of this viable  transaction.  I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly.   I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we intend to retire from in full honor.  Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the next batch which would constitute the new quarter payments for the 2002 financial year.   Thank you and God bless.  Dr James Alabi"

Subject: Info on using Linux operation system?

In answer to the question in Exchange Issue #441, 
WonderPaint gave a pretty darn good explanation of 
what is going on in windows.  He suggests Linux.  

My question is can the current software on my machine 
use Linux if I were to switch to that OS and if not, how 
much software is available for Linux.  Seems all I find is 
for windows and some for the mac.  Thanks.

Hello Nicety,

I  have to agree with Jim Shofstall, http://www.wonderpaint.com,  
when he wrote in Exchange Issue #441: One major problem is that many programs don't release memory 
when you exit.  When working in Windoze I've always taken the 
approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much 
negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer 
for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's 
favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I 
have to make it do anything useful. 

If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE 
download called FreeMem which you can get here;
http://www.meikel.com

This utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you 
also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released. 
This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be 
running at peak performance all the time and much easier than 
constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these 
little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to 
search for.

HTH.  Tony.

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #141:  http://www.floridarental.co.uk
Carol Hall
carol@floridarental.co.uk
~~~~

Just finished looking over your site. It's very flashy and maybe
just a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around
your site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone
three pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to
make your front page navigation a little less confusing?

The ""next page"" tab is right next to one that says ""bookmark
this page"" - no information until you mouseover the tab to
tell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed
with glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not
enough information on your openning page.
~~~~

I also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL
ending with .uk.  Recommendations for this site.
1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the
animation and red text on the yellow background, missing
the first sentence. Remove the animation and add more
details to this important introduction. Instead of using the
'click here' button, just have a text link following directly
after the introduction.
2. On the second page, have all your links the same color,
and all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on
what is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text
on the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially
when it is in the normal blue link color.  Having the
important links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill.
3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but
you don't need the top menu bar when using the framed
menu and the pages are all untitled.

I hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you
want the best site you can have and I think these changes
will make a world of difference.  Once a person gets into the
site you have the information organized and complete. I
even wanted to come and stay!
~~~~

The animations make this site look amateurish from the
beginning.  The flashing ""Bookmark This Site"" makes me
want to leave instead of come back!  The font Comic Sans
MS also looks very kiddy.  Much could be done to improve
this site.
~~~~

I was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the
first screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between
them. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know
where to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should
have been up by the text and that is where I should go.

On the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.  Other than that,
the 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One
suggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have
the menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of
the page as was shown on the 'special offers' page.

The font style and bright colors made the site look casual and
laid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good.
Besides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but
if I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten
that far.
~~~~

This site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read
and navigate. Logically presented and information-rich.
Some pages had too many animated images for my own taste,
but the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold
of PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that
form a background for some images.

In answer to the question in Exchange Issue #441,  WonderPaint gave a pretty darn good explanation of  what is going on in windows.  He suggests Linux.    My question is can the current software on my machine  use Linux if I were to switch to that OS and if not, how  much software is available for Linux.  Seems all I find is  for windows and some for the mac.  Thanks.  Terry High quality LEADS for mlm.  Find three and get yours FREE.

(Issue #439) > >My computer freezes when I use AOL and sometimes when >I'm just using the basic functions of Windows 98. My >defragmentor  keeps starting over and over and my scan >disk never finds anything wrong, but there has to be.  Hello Nicety,  I  have to agree with Jim Shofstall, http://www.wonderpaint.com,   when he wrote in Exchange Issue #441: One major problem is that many programs don't release memory  when you exit.  When working in Windoze I've always taken the  approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much  negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer  for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's  favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I  have to make it do anything useful.   If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE  download called FreeMem which you can get here; http://www.meikel.com  This utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you  also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released.  This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be  running at peak performance all the time and much easier than  constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these  little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to  search for.  HTH.

Comments on Site #141:  http://www.floridarental.co.uk Carol Hall carol@floridarental.co.uk ~~~~  Just finished looking over your site. It's very flashy and maybe just a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around your site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone three pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to make your front page navigation a little less confusing?  The ""next page"" tab is right next to one that says ""bookmark this page"" - no information until you mouseover the tab to tell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed with glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not enough information on your openning page. ~~~~  I also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL ending with .uk.  Recommendations for this site. 1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the animation and red text on the yellow background, missing the first sentence. Remove the animation and add more details to this important introduction. Instead of using the 'click here' button, just have a text link following directly after the introduction. 2. On the second page, have all your links the same color, and all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on what is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text on the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially when it is in the normal blue link color.  Having the important links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill. 3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but you don't need the top menu bar when using the framed menu and the pages are all untitled.  I hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you want the best site you can have and I think these changes will make a world of difference.  Once a person gets into the site you have the information organized and complete. I even wanted to come and stay! ~~~~  The animations make this site look amateurish from the beginning.  The flashing ""Bookmark This Site"" makes me want to leave instead of come back!  The font Comic Sans MS also looks very kiddy.  Much could be done to improve this site. ~~~~  I was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the first screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between them. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know where to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should have been up by the text and that is where I should go.  On the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.  Other than that, the 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One suggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have the menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of the page as was shown on the 'special offers' page.  The font style and bright colors made the site look casual and laid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good. Besides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but if I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten that far. ~~~~  This site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read and navigate. Logically presented and information-rich. Some pages had too many animated images for my own taste, but the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold of PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that form a background for some images. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________________________ moderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com posting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com ______________________________________________________  Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:    mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com Please send suggestions and comments to:    mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com  To change your subscribed address, send both new and old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com See below for unsubscribe instructions.

ike <bearike@sohu.com>, 打造MBA,"Sun, 12 May 2002 16:26:53 +0800","四大素质培养打造MBA


    MBA教育的特点，在素质培养上总是以优秀管理人才必备的素质为培养导向的，    概括起来主要有以下几个方面：    
    1. 分析能力：注重分析能力的培养是各MBA名校的共同特点，而美国商业周刊也将毕业生的分析能力作为商学院排名的重要指标之一。例如清华大学的主要方式便是采用案例教学。教学中所采用的案例部分来自哈佛、MIT，部分是国内企业的实战经验。为提高案例的质量，增强学生解决中国企业的实际运营问题的能力，清华经管学院已计划投资800万人民币建设一个中国企业案例库。    
    2. 团队精神：现代企业经营与管理中，团队精神显得越来越重要，在素质培养中强化团队精神的培养和锤炼无疑是非常明智的。比如清华国际MBA班的学生，在入学的初期就要经过一次为期一周的""ORIENTATION（导向）""活动。活动的主要目的就是通过一系列的游戏（如啤酒运作、破冰者等），拓展训练（如野外生存、高空跨断桥等）训练培养学生的团队意识和观念。这其中，学生也学会如何组成团队以及如何在团队中定位自己以使整个团队形成合力。而名目繁多的俱乐部（如金融俱乐部、IT俱乐部、CPA俱乐部）是同学自由组合和选择的结果。除了作为一个团体能提供的Teamwork的机会，将专业知识深化并与实践结合起来也是俱乐部的一个重要收获。     3. 领导才能：有意识地培养国际MBA学生的领导才能，特别是管理跨国企业的领导才能。除了在相应的课程中讨论之外，开展丰富的第二课堂以及企业家论坛等活动以增加同学们对领导才能的感性认识也是途径之一。这些活动主要是请国内外知名企业的管理人员来演讲授课，并与学生进行自由的交流。清华经管学院第一副院长赵纯均教授曾说过：这些大老板的人生经历就是一部部生动的教材，有许多东西是正式课程里学不到的。    
   4. 实践能力：首先在课程设计上，学院一般安排了企业调查专题、经济分析专题、市场分析专题、财务分析专题以及专业综合专题等实践环节。这些环节都要求学生以小组为单位，直接和企业联系，发现并解决实际问题，最后再提交一份正式的实践总结报告。其次是每年暑假的实习。同学们在MBA就业指导中心的指导下，主动出击，到各行各业，特别是跨国企业进行为期两个月的实习。其中在赞助商的支持下，不少同学到香港、新加坡实习。可以说，这四大素质的培养是MBA教育取胜的关键


                      MBA教育培养企业家的生活方式


    到底中国MBA学校的培养目标应该是什么？     企业家要有三商四能力一素养      21世纪具有国际竞争力的企业家应该具备3商、4种能力、1种素养。     3商首先是高智商，这很好理解，一个弱智的人怎么培养也成不了企业家，但仅有高智商是不够的，企业家必须和社会，和自己的团队打交道，所以必须还有高的情商。同时，他还需要有""胆商""，也就是胆略：要做企业家必须该出手时就出手。它不是盲目的，是善于抓住机遇，我们常说""时间就是金钱""，其实时机才是金钱，谁抓住时机谁就能赚钱。21世纪具有国际竞争力的企业家必须是3商结合。    
    MBA学校的任务就是要开发这3商，GMAT考查的是智商，面试主要是测试情商，另外我们还看背景，这可以考查其胆商。     
    4种能力首先是创新能力，企业竞争必须依靠它；其次是应变能力，MBA要学会在任何条件下都能赚钱，在银根松的时候可以挣到钱银根紧的时候也能挣到钱，在法制健全经济发达的国家、地区能挣到钱，在法制不健全的不发达国家也能挣到钱；第三是公关能力，要善于营造一个良好的周边环境，和同行、政府、客户都要有良好的关系；第四是组织能力，能够把自己的团队凝聚起来。     
   一种素养是必须有多元文化的素养，这是经济全球化和国际竞争的需要。无论是在跨国公司工作，还是创立自己的国际型企业，都必须了解世界上不同国家和民族的文化。     

   鼓励MBA学员进军外企    
   中国应该培养21世纪具有国际竞争力的企业家和高级管理人才。    
    MBA学员进军外企。虽然他们不可避免地要为外国人赚钱，但只有学习外国人怎么赚中国人的钱，才能知道将来怎么赚外国人的钱。他们同时也能成为引进外资和先进技术的桥梁。     
   在学好国际经济运行机制后，这些中国的经济精英既可回到中方企业，重新创业，也可以继续留在外企工作。经济全球化趋势将带来跨国公司的本土化，未来的他们可能成为外国公司的总裁。    

 MBA学院应完全面向市场    

 MBA是一个面向市场的教育，市场已经承认了我们。我们的学费很高，还有很多人报名，因为他们毕业之后，年薪少的都要十几万，最多达60万，我们的学员受到了很多大企业的欢迎。不仅市场承认我们，同行也认可了我们。我们和世界各国很多有名的商学院交换学生""。     

  MBA教育必须面向市场    
  二战以后，美国总裁一级的企业家有1500多人、总经理一级有2000多人是从军事院校毕业的。这给我们敲响了警钟，MBA教育绝不只是学院式教育。有位西点军校毕业的企业家说，""在商学院学的是领导课程，但是我在西点军校学的是领导的生活方式。""那里培养了他一种在逆境中求生存的能力。MBA教育要努力培养这种生活方式。

                           

                        选读MBA的三大原则

    随着中国加入WTO的临近，中国经济与世界经济一体化趋势的脚步越来越快。在这一趋势的推动下，中国需要大量高素质人才，尤其迫切需要培养出一大批国际化的高质量MBA人才。强烈的市场需求，使越来越多的有志之士踊跃投入到考读MBA学位的热潮之中。     

   近几年来，国内MBA教育的发展相当迅猛，然而，各地层出不穷的MBA却令人眼花缭乱，以至于让人良莠难分。     
   
   从学位状况来看，目前国内MBA学位主要来自于以下几个方面：中国国内大学独立培养的，国家承认学历的MBA；中国国内大学独立培养的MBA研究生课程班（没有学位）；国家经贸委用推荐与考试相结合形式招收在职人员攻读的工商硕士EMBA（国家承认学位）；境外一流商学院与国内著名大学合作，颁发境外学位的MBA(国家承认学位)；境外一流商学院与国内大学有些合作，但仍发国内学位的MBA；境外商学院与国内企业或教育机构合作，颁发境外学位的MBA(未得到国家审批并承认学位)。    

   粗略计算一下，中国国内有资格颁发MBA学位的高校有62所之多，加上各种境内外合作项目及许多并未得到国家审批并承认学位的MBA，目前国内每年共有百种以上MBA项目在招生。可以想象，这对一个想读MBA的人来说需要花多少时间来进行选择。稍有不慎，不仅枉费数万元学费及大量时间，而且到头来拿到的一纸文凭可能会是如方鸿渐的克莱登大学学历，没有任何含金量，或含金量不够。     

   
   因此，想报考MBA者不得不擦亮自己的眼睛认真筛选。在新一年度MBA招考季节到来之际，无论招生简章和招生人员的言辞如何华丽、如何吸引，建议报考者先要从以下几个方面去认真衡量，以选择更为可信的MBA教育：     第一，学校MBA的教育实力与社会地位是衡量一个高校MBA教育好坏的重要标准之一。这体现在：     1）权威机构认可     在美国，有一个专门评估商学院的权威机构AACSB国际管理教育协会，其评估范围现在已扩大到世界范围，被其认可的商学院都是可以信赖的。报考者投考前，可以先到它的网站www.aacsb.edu.去查询。 在中国，进行评估的最高权威机构是国务院学位委员会及其领导下的全国工商管理硕士（MBA）教育指导委员会。截止2001年，被国务院学位办批准的MBA教育试点院校达到62所。其中只有极少数的境内外合作项目，颁发境外的并得到国家认可的MBA学位，如北大与美国的福坦莫大学合作的国际MBA，就颁发福坦莫的MBA学位。而其他绝大多数同境外MBA合作的项目，仍是发国内的学位证书，境外商学院只发一纸没有实际意义的认证。     2）师资力量及结构     MBA教师的背景直接影响教学质量。考察教师的实力可根据三方面：     A,师资的总体情况。如教师的知名度，教授、博士所占比例等。     B,教师的学历来源。如他们的学位是什么档次的学校授予的。国际著名大学与一般大学的区别是不言而喻的，美国、欧洲、澳洲的一些好学校因其体制不同也有差别。     C, 教师的实战经验。MBA教育是一个实践性很强的教育，教师与兼职教师的经历如何，如是否担任过企业的顾问，是否有过实际工作经验等，对学生都有着潜移默化的作用。     3）学校的历史渊源、在当地及全国、乃至世界的社会影响。     美国的常青藤学校名声在外，历史悠久、文化蕴涵丰富。他们的校友往往在商界担任高级职务，愿意招聘本校毕业生。因此，该校毕业生往往是大公司、投资银行、保险公司、咨询顾问公司争先招聘的对象，不少人可以同时接到3-6家公司的聘书。这些商学院的MBA学位是一条通向高薪阶层的保证，毕业生的年薪一般在6-15万美金之间。美国的常青藤学校也由此成为世界上所有优秀学生及富豪家族子弟向往的读书地方。     同样，在中国，一些历史悠久的名牌学校也在社会上具有较高的影响力，比如清华大学、北京大学学等，这些学校的毕业生普遍受到社会的欢迎，他们的很多校友在政府及企业里担任重要的职务。当然，它们办MBA的起点比一般的高校也要高。选择这些高校的MBA就读无疑对今后就业和获取高薪职位是相当重要的。     第二，MBA教育的课程设置与专业方向是否灵活多样化，是否适应当今新经济时代的发展 ；     随着用人机构的越来越专业化，技术更新周期的越来越短，不了解行业的发展方向只知道管理的框架是无济于事的。在中国，仅仅说是国际MBA或国际合作MBA，仅仅是外语能力强，而没有主攻方向，没有专业技术特长，是远远不能满足市场需求的。因此，MBA教育的课程设置和专业方向是非常重要的。目前，各个院校MBA教育的必修或核心课程基本上大同小异，但是在选修课与开设专业方向上却可能差别很大。一些实力雄厚的院校为了适应当今市场对一些热门专业的强烈需求，开设了许多新型课程并设置了主攻专业，或提供双学位攻读。     在美国，有几百年历史的罗格斯大学商学院就为MBA开设了几个独特的专业，如艺术管理、电子商务、生物制药管理、供应链管理、人力资源管理、企业家等；另外还设有双学位，如MBA/J.D.(法学)、 MBA/MD(医学博士)、 MBA/MPH(公共健康硕士)、MBA/B.S.（学士直升）。美国另一个常青藤学校宾夕法尼亚大学沃顿商学院也设立有几个新专业，如技术创新、保险与风险管理、不动产管理等等，同时还开设了200多门选修课供学生选择。这些学校的MBA教育非常迎合社会需求，学生毕业后很快就能在岗位上找到用武之地。     在中国，也有一些实力雄厚的院校开设了主攻专业及丰富的课程。   第三，学校是否为经济活跃的地区、是否为商业、金融、贸易中心、是否同国际市场接轨 ；",211.162.252.54,ike2,1,China,"BeiJing Guoxin bilin Telecom Technology Co., Ltd","四大素质培养打造MBA       MBA教育的特点，在素质培养上总是以优秀管理人才必备的素质为培养导向的，    概括起来主要有以下几个方面：         1. 分析能力：注重分析能力的培养是各MBA名校的共同特点，而美国商业周刊也将毕业生的分析能力作为商学院排名的重要指标之一。例如清华大学的主要方式便是采用案例教学。教学中所采用的案例部分来自哈佛、MIT，部分是国内企业的实战经验。为提高案例的质量，增强学生解决中国企业的实际运营问题的能力，清华经管学院已计划投资800万人民币建设一个中国企业案例库。         2. 团队精神：现代企业经营与管理中，团队精神显得越来越重要，在素质培养中强化团队精神的培养和锤炼无疑是非常明智的。比如清华国际MBA班的学生，在入学的初期就要经过一次为期一周的""ORIENTATION（导向）""活动。活动的主要目的就是通过一系列的游戏（如啤酒运作、破冰者等），拓展训练（如野外生存、高空跨断桥等）训练培养学生的团队意识和观念。这其中，学生也学会如何组成团队以及如何在团队中定位自己以使整个团队形成合力。而名目繁多的俱乐部（如金融俱乐部、IT俱乐部、CPA俱乐部）是同学自由组合和选择的结果。除了作为一个团体能提供的Teamwork的机会，将专业知识深化并与实践结合起来也是俱乐部的一个重要收获。     3. 领导才能：有意识地培养国际MBA学生的领导才能，特别是管理跨国企业的领导才能。除了在相应的课程中讨论之外，开展丰富的第二课堂以及企业家论坛等活动以增加同学们对领导才能的感性认识也是途径之一。这些活动主要是请国内外知名企业的管理人员来演讲授课，并与学生进行自由的交流。清华经管学院第一副院长赵纯均教授曾说过：这些大老板的人生经历就是一部部生动的教材，有许多东西是正式课程里学不到的。        4. 实践能力：首先在课程设计上，学院一般安排了企业调查专题、经济分析专题、市场分析专题、财务分析专题以及专业综合专题等实践环节。这些环节都要求学生以小组为单位，直接和企业联系，发现并解决实际问题，最后再提交一份正式的实践总结报告。其次是每年暑假的实习。同学们在MBA就业指导中心的指导下，主动出击，到各行各业，特别是跨国企业进行为期两个月的实习。其中在赞助商的支持下，不少同学到香港、新加坡实习。可以说，这四大素质的培养是MBA教育取胜的关键                         MBA教育培养企业家的生活方式       到底中国MBA学校的培养目标应该是什么？     企业家要有三商四能力一素养      21世纪具有国际竞争力的企业家应该具备3商、4种能力、1种素养。     3商首先是高智商，这很好理解，一个弱智的人怎么培养也成不了企业家，但仅有高智商是不够的，企业家必须和社会，和自己的团队打交道，所以必须还有高的情商。同时，他还需要有""胆商""，也就是胆略：要做企业家必须该出手时就出手。它不是盲目的，是善于抓住机遇，我们常说""时间就是金钱""，其实时机才是金钱，谁抓住时机谁就能赚钱。21世纪具有国际竞争力的企业家必须是3商结合。         MBA学校的任务就是要开发这3商，GMAT考查的是智商，面试主要是测试情商，另外我们还看背景，这可以考查其胆商。          4种能力首先是创新能力，企业竞争必须依靠它；其次是应变能力，MBA要学会在任何条件下都能赚钱，在银根松的时候可以挣到钱银根紧的时候也能挣到钱，在法制健全经济发达的国家、地区能挣到钱，在法制不健全的不发达国家也能挣到钱；第三是公关能力，要善于营造一个良好的周边环境，和同行、政府、客户都要有良好的关系；第四是组织能力，能够把自己的团队凝聚起来。         一种素养是必须有多元文化的素养，这是经济全球化和国际竞争的需要。无论是在跨国公司工作，还是创立自己的国际型企业，都必须了解世界上不同国家和民族的文化。          鼓励MBA学员进军外企        中国应该培养21世纪具有国际竞争力的企业家和高级管理人才。         MBA学员进军外企。虽然他们不可避免地要为外国人赚钱，但只有学习外国人怎么赚中国人的钱，才能知道将来怎么赚外国人的钱。他们同时也能成为引进外资和先进技术的桥梁。         在学好国际经济运行机制后，这些中国的经济精英既可回到中方企业，重新创业，也可以继续留在外企工作。经济全球化趋势将带来跨国公司的本土化，未来的他们可能成为外国公司的总裁。       MBA学院应完全面向市场       MBA是一个面向市场的教育，市场已经承认了我们。我们的学费很高，还有很多人报名，因为他们毕业之后，年薪少的都要十几万，最多达60万，我们的学员受到了很多大企业的欢迎。不仅市场承认我们，同行也认可了我们。我们和世界各国很多有名的商学院交换学生""。         MBA教育必须面向市场       二战以后，美国总裁一级的企业家有1500多人、总经理一级有2000多人是从军事院校毕业的。这给我们敲响了警钟，MBA教育绝不只是学院式教育。有位西点军校毕业的企业家说，""在商学院学的是领导课程，但是我在西点军校学的是领导的生活方式。""那里培养了他一种在逆境中求生存的能力。MBA教育要努力培养这种生活方式。                                                       选读MBA的三大原则      随着中国加入WTO的临近，中国经济与世界经济一体化趋势的脚步越来越快。在这一趋势的推动下，中国需要大量高素质人才，尤其迫切需要培养出一大批国际化的高质量MBA人才。强烈的市场需求，使越来越多的有志之士踊跃投入到考读MBA学位的热潮之中。          近几年来，国内MBA教育的发展相当迅猛，然而，各地层出不穷的MBA却令人眼花缭乱，以至于让人良莠难分。             从学位状况来看，目前国内MBA学位主要来自于以下几个方面：中国国内大学独立培养的，国家承认学历的MBA；中国国内大学独立培养的MBA研究生课程班（没有学位）；国家经贸委用推荐与考试相结合形式招收在职人员攻读的工商硕士EMBA（国家承认学位）；境外一流商学院与国内著名大学合作，颁发境外学位的MBA(国家承认学位)；境外一流商学院与国内大学有些合作，但仍发国内学位的MBA；境外商学院与国内企业或教育机构合作，颁发境外学位的MBA(未得到国家审批并承认学位)。         粗略计算一下，中国国内有资格颁发MBA学位的高校有62所之多，加上各种境内外合作项目及许多并未得到国家审批并承认学位的MBA，目前国内每年共有百种以上MBA项目在招生。可以想象，这对一个想读MBA的人来说需要花多少时间来进行选择。稍有不慎，不仅枉费数万元学费及大量时间，而且到头来拿到的一纸文凭可能会是如方鸿渐的克莱登大学学历，没有任何含金量，或含金量不够。              因此，想报考MBA者不得不擦亮自己的眼睛认真筛选。在新一年度MBA招考季节到来之际，无论招生简章和招生人员的言辞如何华丽、如何吸引，建议报考者先要从以下几个方面去认真衡量，以选择更为可信的MBA教育：     第一，学校MBA的教育实力与社会地位是衡量一个高校MBA教育好坏的重要标准之一。这体现在：     1）权威机构认可     在美国，有一个专门评估商学院的权威机构AACSB国际管理教育协会，其评估范围现在已扩大到世界范围，被其认可的商学院都是可以信赖的。报考者投考前，可以先到它的网站www.aacsb.edu.去查询。 在中国，进行评估的最高权威机构是国务院学位委员会及其领导下的全国工商管理硕士（MBA）教育指导委员会。截止2001年，被国务院学位办批准的MBA教育试点院校达到62所。其中只有极少数的境内外合作项目，颁发境外的并得到国家认可的MBA学位，如北大与美国的福坦莫大学合作的国际MBA，就颁发福坦莫的MBA学位。而其他绝大多数同境外MBA合作的项目，仍是发国内的学位证书，境外商学院只发一纸没有实际意义的认证。     2）师资力量及结构     MBA教师的背景直接影响教学质量。考察教师的实力可根据三方面：     A,师资的总体情况。如教师的知名度，教授、博士所占比例等。     B,教师的学历来源。如他们的学位是什么档次的学校授予的。国际著名大学与一般大学的区别是不言而喻的，美国、欧洲、澳洲的一些好学校因其体制不同也有差别。     C,

SITES TO REVIEW: Site #124: http://www.BestWayToShop.com Dale Pike rhinopez@aol.com Site #125: http://www.wedeliverparties.com Dawn Clemons dclemons7@home.com Site #126: http://www.EClassifiedshq.com Carol Cohen Opp0rtunity@aol.com SITE REVIEWED: Comments on Site #123: http://netsbestinfo.homestead.com/nbi.html Dennis damorganjr@yahoo.com ~~~~ I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third 
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as 
shown on the page. I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter. As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person 
doing the page is always good.  We need some information about 
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. ~~~~ Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations 
for improving your page. 1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading 
for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like 
you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much. 2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you 
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend 
look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional. 3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you 
their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know 
they can unsubscribe. 4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. 
It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to. 5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your 
newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
an archive to see what information you have offered in the past. 6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that 
page. Remove all pricing information from the home page. ~~~~ I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. 
I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. 
I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds 
site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. 
A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it! ~~~~ This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is 
personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted 
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word 
missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be 
smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers* ~~~~ Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also 
are errors in the following paragraphs : 
""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, 
send your to my email"" ~~~~ A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's 
newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be 
a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to 
have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably 
didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be 
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to 
subscribe. As it is, I would not bother. ~~~~ What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful 
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter 
with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) 
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. 
He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get 
from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about 
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 
points size which gets difficult to read. ~~~~ A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its 
just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an 
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough 
move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably 
you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting 
the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, 
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click 
for more info on your free ads. ________________________________________ VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN! Help out the winner of the free website redesign by voting for

But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the 
pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures. How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages 
without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with 
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my 
favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. Mark moviebuff@cliffhanger.com ANSWERS: From: Zaak  - Zaako@linkpaks.com Subject: Access using a proxy >From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) >Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) --> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is 
blocking 50% of 
the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by 
using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is 
there a way to get access to these sites? -- A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. 
I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then 
from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that 
block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money 
with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and 
because they allow me to surf anonymously! I have a detailed right-up on them at http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

SITES TO REVIEW: Site #124: http://www.BestWayToShop.com Dale Pike rhinopez@aol.com Site #125: http://www.wedeliverparties.com Dawn Clemons dclemons7@home.com Site #126: http://www.EClassifiedshq.com Carol Cohen Opp0rtunity@aol.com SITE REVIEWED: Comments on Site #123: http://netsbestinfo.homestead.com/nbi.html Dennis damorganjr@yahoo.com ~~~~ I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and  I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third  paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as  shown on the page. I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should  be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered  on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter. As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person  doing the page is always good.  We need some information about  why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. ~~~~ Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations  for improving your page. 1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to  'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading  for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like  you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much. 2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you  to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend  look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional. 3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like  before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you  their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know  they can unsubscribe. 4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter.  It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to. 5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your  newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or  an archive to see what information you have offered in the past. 6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that  page. Remove all pricing information from the home page. ~~~~ I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text.  I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read  quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily.  I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds  site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted.  A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it! ~~~~ This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the  message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is  personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted  to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see  a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word  missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be  smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers* ~~~~ Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also  are errors in the following paragraphs :  ""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement,  send your to my email"" ~~~~ A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's  newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be  a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to  have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably  didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be  better served if he at least put some of the things out there for  all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to  subscribe. As it is, I would not bother. ~~~~ What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful  resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy  advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter  with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com)  asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad.  He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get  from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about  the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40  points size which gets difficult to read. ~~~~ A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on  the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its  just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an  advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough  move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter  itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of  ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably  you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting  the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue,  a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click  for more info on your free ads. ________________________________________ VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!

QUESTIONS: From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com Subject: Using pictures as links I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages.  But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the  pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures. How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages  without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with  actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my  favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. Mark moviebuff@cliffhanger.com ANSWERS: From: Zaak  - Zaako@linkpaks.com Subject: Access using a proxy >From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) >Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) --> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is  blocking 50% of  the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by  using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is  there a way to get access to these sites? -- A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself.  I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then  from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that  block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money  with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and  because they allow me to surf anonymously! I have a detailed right-up on them at http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

(Issue #422) CJ, Two such sites that allows proxy surfing are: http://www.anonymise.com and http://www.anonymizer.com . However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work.  Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or  may not visit, then it is time to change providers!

Important Message! <regal3@freeuk.com>,Your Shop web site is NOT being SEEN!,"Fri, 26 Jul 2002 06:10:34 +0200","Your Shop Web Site is 
NOT Being SEEN
WHY? 
NO ONE CAN FIND IT!

YOUR web site is NOT on many search engines and at the Bottom of their listings and as a result

YOU are LOSING customers who cannot find you!

Can this be changed? YES!

Think about it!
Just as you have a web designer to build your site and a company to host your site,does it not make sense to use a company that specializes in professionally submitting your web site.

 A Shocking Fact!
Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site seen!  Yes, they may submit your site to a few search engines periodically but to stay on the TOP of the search engines is an aggressive business.

Getting onto the search engines and at the top of their listings doesn't  just happen.

You have to be put there!

What the.Net, The Internet Magazine 8/2000 said:
""You have your web site designed and have sorted out the maintenance and waiting for the business to roll in, but there's one small problem.... No one knows!""

You need a professional company to do it!

Your Money Back
Guarantee! 
If you do not receive confirmation from the search engines that we submit your web site to, we will give you your money back! Guaranteed!

There is nothing to lose!

Most of your competition are unaware of the facts below!
This is to YOUR Advantage!


Web Site Facts
Remember ""The Yellow Pages"" Rule! 
 A search engine is like an enormous ""yellow pages"" with thousands of companies advertising the same product.  Unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.  Unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the ""Yellow pages"" in the world.

What does it take to be seen on the 
Search Engines?

Appreciate the Three Golden Rules
q Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom! 
q Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on).
q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines! 
Use the right ones and you go up.
Get it wrong and you go to the bottom!
Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines. 
Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried.  Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased. 

It is essential to be on them!

Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need. 
 This can make the difference between new customers 
FINDING your web site or NOT!

So YOUR web site can be FOUND and SEEN  For Twelve Months! Guaranteed!    (See our testimonials)   Think about it! Just as you have a web designer to build your site and a company to host your site,does it not make sense to use a company that specializes in professionally submitting your web site.  Getting your web site FOUND and SEEN!    A Shocking Fact! Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site seen!  Yes, they may submit your site to a few search engines periodically but to stay on the TOP of the search engines is an aggressive business.  Getting onto the search engines and at the top of their listings doesn't  just happen.  You have to be put there!  What the.Net, The Internet Magazine 8/2000 said: ""You have your web site designed and have sorted out the maintenance and waiting for the business to roll in, but there's one small problem.... No one knows!""  You need a professional company to do it!  Your Money Back Guarantee!  If you do not receive confirmation from the search engines that we submit your web site to, we will give you your money back! Guaranteed!  There is nothing to lose!   Some testimonials of those that have used  Regal Telecom ""This service is my secret weapon. I never believed it was possible to have such a rapid response."" etvcom.tv   ""I have been truly amazed by the results. I have received enquires from Austria, Hawaii, Spain and many different parts of Britain for my international real estate business. This is directly due to this service. I definitely recommend it!  Worth every penny!"" keyhomes.net  ""We run a Cancer Clinic and it is essential that our web site is submitted to as many search engines as possible. We are looking forward to having the capability to do online video conferencing and online diagnosis with our patients from many parts of the world. It is a real advantage to have the capabilities that  Regal Telecom offers."" Mari Posas Cancer Clinic.   ""We never received a single inquiry until we used Regal Telecom"" noniuk.co.uk   To submit your web site all we need is your web site and  e-mail address.  We will do the rest!

Then be ready for the response!  Within 24 hours your web site will begin to be submitted to over 350 search engines world wide and every month  thereafter for the next year.  The results will astound you!  Most of your competition are unaware of the facts below! This is to YOUR Advantage!   Web Site Facts Remember ""The Yellow Pages"" Rule!   A search engine is like an enormous ""yellow pages"" with thousands of companies advertising the same product.  Unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.  Unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the ""Yellow pages"" in the world.  What does it take to be seen on the  Search Engines?  Appreciate the Three Golden Rules q Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom!  q Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on). q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines!  Use the right ones and you go up. Get it wrong and you go to the bottom! Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines.  Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried.  Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased.   It is essential to be on them!  Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need.   This can make the difference between new customers  FINDING your web site or NOT!
